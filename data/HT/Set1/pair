I am  17 and this is my first time with these symptoms, please help.	The The only way to tell whether you are pregnant or not is to take a pregnancy test. As doctors, the first thing we do when we hear a woman is having a light or missed period or abnormal spotting, we check a pregnancy test. You can either take a home pregnancy test as long as it has been 5- 6 weeks since your last normal period, or you can go see your doctor and they can test you. A home pregnancy test is 97% accurate if taken a week or more after the missed period. A blood test can tell if you are pregnant as soon as 7 days after conception and a doctor's urine pregnancy test can tell if you are pregnant around when you next period should come. There are other reasons besides pregnancy that can cause a woman to miss a period or have symptoms of pregnancy such as: stress, diet, excessive exercise or a hormone imbalance such as with a thyroid disorder or polycystic ovarian syndrome. If you continue to have an irregular cycle, you should give your doctor or your ob/gyne a call. Good luck!

It is very difficult to say without actually seeing the lesions in question. Please see your doctor right away. Best of luck.

6702370	Taking sulfamethoxazole for cellulitis on my leg but now I've been getting tiny really itchy hives on my hands.  Am I allergic and what should I do?

You could get blood clots from immobility (sitting all the time) or if you have certain underlying conditions (cancer, certain genes), but not from poor diet alone. My advice - clean up your diet, move (exercise), see your doctor to be sure you don't have something scary going on. Good luck!

494084	Have a tiny red spot on skin under right chest (upper rib). Not raised or itchy. Looks like cut but isn't.I have  2 others on left pectoral(also tiny)?

Sometimes, these can even be malignant melanomas. See the dermatologist so she can help sort it out.

Many times microcalcifications can be biopsied with a needle using stereotactic guidance.

But some may suit your needs better than others. Having fibroids by itself is not an indication for surgery. We usually recommend a procedure based on the symptoms that you're having. Also your desire for future fertility plays a role. Interventional radiological techniques such as uterine artery embolization can be useful. Having said that, hysterectomy is definitive.

You should discuss the game plan with your doctor. Just because you can take them together doesn't mean that you should.
744425	How can you most effectively end dry callus feet?	Callus A callus can be normal due to increase pressure.

Thats my results	HSV1, no HSV2 The results mean you are carrying herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), usually from oral infection in childhood, so you probably have had it for years.

Not all related The popping of the ears can be easily explained by Eustachian tube opening when you swallow. This is absolutely normal and you are just aware of a normal physiological activity.

Prophylactic placement of a ureteral stent prior to eswl is somewhat controversial depending on the situation. Stents themselves may cause significant pain and other problems. If there is no obstruction, infection or other complicating factor, then placement of a stent before eswl is usually not necessary for stones less than 2 cm. Also, a stent can always be placed after the eswl if needed.

Probably concern The rule of thumb for any antibiotic to work is 72 hours. In your case it's been less than that, however, the fact the disease is getting worse is a red flag. Bactrim may not be a right choice for a swollen lymph node. It is a good choice for a skin infection, but yours appears to be related to the lymph node. I'd call the prescribing physician and report your symptoms.

If If this is the first time you are having these symptoms then an exam by your doctor is in order. If you are dealing with yeast, then for the future you will be sure of the signs and symptoms if they return, and you can self treat with an over the counter vaginal yeast infection cream. If not yeast, your doctor may want to test for a vaginal bacterial infection or even an std (sexually transmitted disease). .

Regardless, if your symptoms are still present then you need an evaluation. Good luck.

Monitoring Centers Lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells/digested food.

Possible hip It may be an arthritic hip based on the distribution of your pain. Does it hurt to get a shoe or sock on that side? Do you limp after walking awhile on that side?

Will probably subside but you can add Alleve or Motrin if you don't have stomach problems.

Go soon and hope things clear up quickly.

381987	How common is it for a 17 year old to get cervical cancer with genital warts and an iud? I have had the IUD for 4 years now. And, i just got rid of my genital warts. But, I do not get regular pap tests.	The The fact that you have genital warts means you have been exposed to the hpv virus, there are 100's of types of hpv, some causing warts, and other types causing cervical cancer. The only way to tell if you have cervical changes from hpv is to have a pap smear. However, new guidelines from the american college of gynecologists (acog) recommend pap smears not be done until age 21. Acog states, " although the rate of hpv infection is high among sexually active adolescents, invasive cervical cancer is very rare in women under age 21. The immune system clears the hpv infection within one to two years among most adolescent women. Because the adolescent cervix is immature, there is a higher incidence of hpv-related precancerous lesions (called dysplasia). However, the large majority of cervical dysplasias in adolescents resolve on their own without treatment" you should still visit your doctor for their input, and other testing, mainly std when indicated. Even though you have an iud, you still need to protect yourself against std's, this can be done by using condoms with any sexual encounter, including oral, anal, and genital. Good luck.

Based Based on the symptoms you described you could be dealing with pharyngitis (infection of the throat) which could be caused by a bacterial or a virus; versus a sinus infection. Other more serious less likely possibilities include influenza (flu) or meningitis (infection of the central nervous system). Regardless, you need to see your health care provider right away; the provider will ask you specific questions about your illness and perform a physical exam. You can expect that your provider will likely perform a throat culture or a test called a rapid strep test and possibly blood tests to check for certain infections. Your doctor/provider will make a decision based on the test results regarding which treatment is appropriate. If a more serious problem is suspected, your doctor will likely send you to the emergency department.

Vaginal irritation Certain soaps and preservatives can cause recurrent irritations. Be careful of soaps or feminine products with propylene glycol especially.
705806	What causes a swollen lymph node in neck and acne on the shoulder?	Probably nothing Acne confined to a shoulder may be from rubbing; we see this in men who bench-press large amounts of weight.

372376	What kind of antibiotic is best for a foot infection following treatment for plantar warts? Had cryo liquid nitrogen and canthacur treatment on foot for several plantar warts 2 days previously.  The post treatment instructions said to call with any signs	Thanks Thanks for your question! after having liquid nitrogen treatment for plantar warts, it is not unusual to have some mild redness around the treatment area. This is called "reactive erythema" and is a sign of the inflammation around the area that was treated. However, redness that is warm and/or painful, or that spreads or that drains pus, can be a sign of cellulitis - a bacterial infection of the skin. It can be difficult for patients to tell the difference sometimes. I would recommend seeing your doctor right away to determine if antibiotics are needed. If it is cellulitis, the most common bacteria that cause infection in this area are staphylococcus and streptococcus. You may have heard of a bacteria that is more difficult to treat with antibiotics called methicillin resistent staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). There are also other bacteria that can cause the infection but these are the most common. Cephalexin is a common choice for skin infections but would likely not be effective for mrsa. After examining your foot, your doctor can make an educated decision regarding which antibiotic is right for you, taking into account which medications you are already taking, your allergies, and your examination. Never take antibiotics unless they are prescribed by a medical professional for your specific problem. It can be dangerous to take leftover medications from a previous infection or to purchase antibiotics on the internet. At best, it can confuse the picture for your doctor if a wound culture is needed. I wish you the best!

611737	Irregular periods, oligomenorrhea, no hirsutism, acne, normal hormone profile. What could be the cause?	Ovulatory disorder You probably do not have pcos but with irregular periods you have some form of ovulatory dysfunction; probably hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction. With a normal hormone profile you do not have anything to worry about but i will be harder to get pregnant and probably will need fertility medications to induce regular ovulatory cycling.

Past wk pain&gt;tia	CTS / Ganglion cyst Without more information (which fingers are most affected-exact location and texture of the lump) i'm giving you the most common cause.

1105826	Can you tell me if you are vaccinated with hepatitis a, b, c can you still get infected ?	Yes You can't be vaccinated against hepatitis c because there's no vaccine.

After being vaccinated, you can find out whether you're protected with blood tests: total HAV antibody for a and hbsab for b.

402250	Is it possibly a blood clot? My girlfriend had a bruise that seemingly appeared spontaneously on the inside of her left arm, near the elbow, a little over a week ago. The bruise has faded, but the knot that was under the bruise --fairly large and hard-- i	Hello. Hello. I can't diagnose her symptoms. However, she may have had trauma to her arm. There are nerves that traverse the elbow, even if the external bruising is fading, there may be a hematoma (like a big clot of blood) that is putting pressure on one of her nerves. Or there could be swelling. The nerves are less well protected where they dive in or out of muscle. The pressure on nerve could be leading to numbness. I see you have this tagged for cardiology. This is usually not the same type of scenario as a deep venous thrombosis that may be throwing clots to the lungs. It sounds like that the numbness is intermittent. I would suggest that if there is a position that seems to alleviate the numbness that she place her arm in that position. I will change tag to orthopedic surgery, so that one of the orthopods might answer it. I don't see a need for an emergency evaluation, but lets see if any orthopods answer.

Usually yeast vaginitis is not a painful problem, which makes me wonder about the herpes infection you mentioned.

Post nasal drip Your child may have a viral infection which typically can take 10 days to clear up. If there is a fever, problems breathing or any pain, I think he should be seen right away. Keeping him well hydrated, using nasal saline and gentle suction and a mild decongestant for children at night will help to alleviate his symptoms. If the cough lingers more than 3 weeks, he should be seen for chronic cough.
793784	I had a surgery in feb to remove a cyst on right knee. It was non-cancerous.Today i see it starting to come back. They said it might.. But this fast?	Yes.

If you reach 100 f or fail to get as low as 98.6 f during a 24 hour period you are considered febrile (having fever), but even then it may not be clinically relevant.

Yes It's unlikely that you would get pregnant on day #2 of your menstrual cycle. I like to tell my patients that there are no such things as a 'safe' day. 6 days after your period would be way early to have pregnancy symptoms as the pregnancy doesn't implant until 6 days after intercourse.

Could be a dry socket, or if you had a prosthesis placed in the area, it may need to be adjusted.

So my best guess is that you didn't have a yeast infection, which is why the Monistat isn't making any difference. Stop all treatment for several days, then see a doctor for if you believe discharge still is abnormal. And no sex in the meantime. Good luck!
548779	I have breast cancer, can I do a sentinal lymph node biopsy before i decide on which procedure to do (lumpectomy or mastectomy)?	Sentinel Lymph Node It doesn't make much sense to do a sentinel lymph node biopsy before surgery. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is done at the same time as your surgery in order to stage the tumor. The top priority here is to get your tumor out. Hopefully your surgeon would have explained to you that there is no difference in survival or cancer recurrence whether you choose mastectomy or lumpectomy as your treatment.

1578667	I was woke up this morning with stomach pains kinda like contractions I had this before and I was pregnant.But I'm on Depo-Provera no cycle in two years ?	Cramping can be from a lot of things . Periumbilical cramping would be small intestinal cramping and off time is related to physical environmental or emotional stressors. This can be something you have eaten or are sensitive to. This can also be a result of viral illness or simple emotional stress being internalized. Normally this will pass with a few days and I would suggest some clear fluids with a little sugar such as Kool-Aid, Gatorade or popsicles for a few days. These objects are pretty easy on your intestines.

Quick way to find out whether you're pregnant (or not) is to take a home pregnancy test; very accurate and inexpensive, available at most drug stores w/o prescription. It's possible to have your period and still be pregnant so take the test since you don't feel right. Then go get tested for sexually transmitted disease since unprotected sex leaves you at risk for both.

1100454	Pressure r side jaw, head & neck.Swollen gum around tooth(no infection, per dentist). R eyelid spasms. Injury to r side of head 16yrs ago(hit by rock)?	Contradictory How could you have a swollen gum, along with pressure on the right side of the jaw and not having an infection? By definition, swollen gum means there is an antigenic response in your gum and it is an indication of infection.

For confirmation, follow instructions described in http://www.formefirst.com/eNewsletter06.html.
6729284	I have swollen lymph nodes in my groin. They are not painful and I have no infection. My GP doesn't seem to be concerned. Should I be concerned?	No painless enlarged lymph nodes in the growing are usually caused by little nicks and minor skin infections from the toes on up the legs. Bacteria can drain up the lymphatics to the lymph nodes in the groin, which destroy them, enlarging in the process. They eventually will return to normal size. Rarely, a node will becomeabscessed and require therapy
553186	I have a sore throat &it feels almost raw on the left side, a runny nose, headaches, congestion, cough, little wheezing when i breath w/ discomfort.	The wheezing It seems you have a viral infection but I am most concerned about the wheezing part, as a viral infection or any urti can trigger asthmatic symptoms. Consult a doctor and treat the wheeze.

But again if not causing excessive bleeding or reducing chances of pregnancy why not just wait and watch?
1165353	If you get cold sores, can you transmit hsv1 to someone genitally through oral sex when you don't have a cold sore?	Yes That has been the greatest problem we've had with hsv as the transmission is not at a time with lesion, we are careful at that time. It when we don't have anything to show for a problem that we can transmit it to another person.
97706	Mrsa staph infection skin problems normal in nursing homes?	Wrong word "normal" isn't really the proper descriptor - serious infections are never normal. Mrsa is, however, a *common* problem in nursing homes -- unfortunately. Good facilities are always on the lookout for infections of any kind in their residents, and when they find them, they treat them promptly.
1043885	My daughter is now fourteen since age ten she has been getting i ovarian cysts that rupture at least once a year she hasn't started her period yet?	Doesnt make sense Something does not add up here. If her ovaries are so active that she is getting ovarian cysts that rupture then she should also have gone through puberty and be having menstrual cycles. If this is true then she should see a gynecologist who has experience and interest in pediatric gynecology to better evaluate this contradictory problem.
1573966	Sonography report  Uterus is retroflexed & bulky & normal in shape. Thick Endometrium (15 mm).A posterior fibroid seen. What does it mean? Pregnancy?	Depends If the ultrasound was done to detect a pregnancy, then this could mean that the pregnancy hormone concentration is too low and the pregnancy too young to be detected on ultrasound. It can also mean that the pregnancy is outside the uterus. Endometrium is thin at the beginning of the cycle and gets thicker until after ovulation. 15 mm is on the high end of what one would expect.
1283972	Hcg level 4/14 1299, 4/16 1288, 4/21 1490 & transvaginal ultrasounds on 4/14 & 4/21 show irregularly shaped fluid collection & no signs of pregnant ideas?	Miscarriage What you have is an abnormal pregnancy - a miscarriage. Bleeding will begin, but it may take a few weeks more. You can't do anything yourself to make a miscarriage happen, and you can't do anything to stop one. About 1 in every 5 pregnancies miscarried - usual when there is something wrong with baby.

1476392	Can advantan ointment be used for red rash under breasts(probably heat rash as it is not always itchy or spreading)-is it ok to use it on heat rash?	Possibly but Since the problem is more likely from a fungal infection (monilial), a topical anti-fungal cream would work better although Advantan may mask the inflammation temporarily. Once the rash has cleared, consider applying anti-perspirant (unscented) under the breasts as a preventive measure.
1135161	Arm stopping at my shoulder, not only is the thumb swollen my whole hand is, do you think its broken or sprained, what to do?	Swollen hand I would go to er asap and have it studied. You are young and there is always a reason. The docs will track it down.

Go to Family Doctor There is absolutely no need to waste the expense and time at an emergency room. This problem should be managed by a family physician or a primary care specialist. This is the very reason one has a family doctor so that these kind of problems can be evaluated and followed over time.

See dermatologist if topical OTC hydrocortisone twice a day doesn't help, Does not sound like STD, but see derm for answers

Since not urgent, so, still make effort to watch & identify potential offending factors in living environment and lifestyles besides tracing down if any family members have similar conditions as yours or if it's related with seasonal or hot muddy weather.

See your MD Any new discharge from the nipple should be evaluated with 'cytology', basically a pap smear of the fluid. Please see your hcp for a careful breast exam, possible breast ultrasound and further evaluation. Don't ignore this...
1262288	Could people with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus/ra benefit from taking evening primrose oil? What about fish oil?

Please do not take either of these without discussing the matter with your doctor.
351983	What is the difference between an osteochondral surgery and partial knee replacement?	Preservation vs repl Bone preservation vs bone replacement. Based on your age each has an advantage over the other. After 40 years of age replacement is a more predictable procedure.

Groin rash It could be related to a fungal infection from sweating, has nothing to do with allergies, you should have someone look at it to treat it properly.
870245	Am having stomach pain, my breast is getting bigger, and am always feeling weak but am not pregnant according to my blood test result 1, 20miu/ml, ?	Premen Syndrome Many of the symptoms are consistent with the verge of menstruation (premenstrual syndrome) and the various hormone peaks/spikes. I would follow up with your pcp/ob-gyn doc to make certain it is nothing but cramping and bloating. The breasts will also enlarge as the hormone levels increase just prior to menstruation.
1482476	I have pressure/pain in the right side of head if I lay on that side or on back. Have had tension headaches lately and do have sinus pressure.	Get checked See a neurologist and have your cranial joints (TM joints, occiput and frontal sinus) for the presence of toxins, pathogens, allergens as the cause of the tension HAs. Make sure you rule out the presence of mold toxins as a factor for the sinus pressure.
368521	Why is complete knee dislocation so rare?	Takes a large force Fortunately it is rare for a real (not patella) dislocation you must be hit with enough force to tear all 4ligaments in the knee this is a severe injury with a poor prognosis for the future no matter how treated.

You state you are sexually active but don't say what form of birth control you are using. That being said no birth control method is 100% safe except abstinence. I would suggest you get a pregnancy test and repeat it several weeks down the road. Good luck.
6708782	I woke up today with a stiff neck on my left side and my shoulder blade hurts too. My lymph node is pea sized in my neck and it feels swollen. Help?'	Viral infection and musculo-skletal pain. An upper respiratory tract infection or a cold can inflame your cervical lymphonode. It gradually goes down after your cold or URI is over. The neck and shoulder pain could be due to sleeping on your left side. Take advil for the pain. It can take up to 10 days to get over the pain.
393987	I keep having chest pain with pressure that is unrelieved by pain medications (norco 5/325). Nothing on stress, ekg, or CT tests hi, starting in december of 2011, i had excruciating pain in my chest around the sternum and the between the shoulder blades t	This This is a complex question, with no simple answer. First of all, stress tests, although an excellent screening test, can have false negatives. An excellent, low risk test for coronary disease currently is a special ct scan called a ct angiogram, or cta. Is this the test you had? If so, then your risk of coronary sources of your pain is probably negligible. Secondly, if you are having shortness of breath with a normal ordinary ct scan, you probably don't have intrinsic lung (parenchymal) disease. This being said...There are other causes of shortness of breath.....Like asthma etc. Some other chest diseases can cause chest pain and perceived shortness of breath, like esophageal disorders. These are more common in patients with autoimmune problems like lupus.
1045487	Had unprotected sex and took Plan B the day after, but now 2 weeks after the pill and a period i'm having redish/brown discharge. Am i pregnant?	Most likely not You are probably not pregnant but start with a home pregnancy test which you can repeat in a week, if you are still worried see your doctor. You could also have a vaginal infection - Plan B only prevents infections not sexually transmitted diseases. Use barrier contraception in the future.
609762	What does "acute infection" mean for herpes? As i got IgG negative & IgM 1.5+ index.	Herpes simplex This generally refers to the infection that occurs when you are exposed to the virus for the first time. This is indicated by the presence of igm antibodies in the absence of igg antibodies. You can also have acute infection with recurrence, but then you would also have igg antibodies present as well as igm. You cannot reliably separate types 1 & 2 using antibody testing.
6647011	I have had a migraine for the past 32 hrs along with a sore throat, nausea Etc. My throat is swollen and red, hard to swallow, yellow patch on roof.	If unusual, Have an examination. Unless this is the pattern you expect from your headache - and it's not likely - see your doctor. It may be a cold or the flu or something like that, but if it does need a Rx, that's the way to get it. Best!
1465746	What is this i felt like a hard part in my stomach,i got dizzy,numbness in hands,and  difficult to breath,sometimes chest pain?	Poss heart attack go to the ER or Doctor now
1032563	I had a flu shot about a week ago. I now have bad sinus pressure, sneezing, runny nose, and headaches. Also very sleepy. No fever, though. Any idea?	Cold It sounds like you have a common cold, which has nothing to do with the flu shot. Flu shots are given during cold season, so it's not unusual to get a cold after receiving the vaccine. You should take the usual over-the-counter medications that you would take to treat cold symptoms.
1444459	CHolesterol 218:   age 61 post menopausal female.  LDL:  78; HDL 127.  Walk 5-8 miles daily.  Should I be concerned?   Don't smoke/drink.  Thanks.	Ideal Your cholesterol profile is ideal.
6735034	6/f/3p26.3 duplication (GDD, small stature). Unusually cold, sore, red, swollen hands in cold weather. Not improved upon warming near heater 30mins.	Not enough cases I found only 2 other cases reported of a duplication of 3p26. 3. One is from New Zeland. She sounds like she could use heated mittens in the cold--available at ski shops. Impossible to say whether it is related to the duplication. You could contact the authors of this publication--I'm sure that they would be fascinated to see her. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/crig/2014/295359/
765402	I'm having numbness on left side of body - hand leg & foot. I have lupus & MS & diabetes.  Its been getting worse for 2 days now?	Many possibilities Numbness can occur from various reasons. Some potential causes include vitamin deficiency, nerve damage, nerve compression, and alcohol over consumption, side effects of different medications, or as a result of different systemic medical conditions such as diabetes. Get evaluated by a professional to determine the diagnosis. Treatment is based on the diagnosis.
1583346	I have cervical lymph node, my Platelet count is 330.00,Lymphocytes is 39.00,low HCT/PCV, MCV, MCH,MCHC,RDW &WBC 4.32, the lymph is not soft and large?	Work up anemia Nothing else that you have told me has me worried in the least. You do need to find out why you are anemic (low hct/pcv). Unless it's obvious from diet and/or very heavy monthly loss, a serious investigation is in order.
1555161	Naked foreplay and precum near vagina period due in a few days stomach cramps sore upper legs backpain increased urination mood swings, period or preg?	Unlikely Hi. If nothing made it's way into your vagina, you're probably OK. Precum "near" vagina is not a very explicit locale, but sperm count is very low in precum and if it's only outside your vagina, pregnancy is highly, highly unlikely. It's amazing how situations like that progress, however. You may want to consider birth control before it goes any further. Good luck!

524636	Can you take 25mg Benadryl 12 hours after taking regular allegra?
I take toprol XL 50 mg for blood pressure	Yes. Benadryl would be safe to take with allegra. Remember not to operate any heavy machinery or drive while taking this medication. It will not affect your blood pressure unless you are taking Allegra-D or the formulation with pseudophedrine.
851602	My right ear pops a lot but my left is harder to. I take allegra, nas-o-nex nasal spray& saline spray daily is this just allergies or something else?	See an allergist If you are taking multiple medicines and still having problems it is time to see a specialist for evaluation and treatment. An allergist can determine if you have allergies.
623151	Can a ruptured ovarian cyst cause internal bleeding?	Ruptured cyst Absolutely a ruptured cyst can cause internal bleeeding.
1400791	When doing duplex of the carotid arteries, how high up the neck do u see? Where does the sight usually end? Can u see in level with the cheekbones?	Usually up to the area where the arteries enter the skull. So, no, it does not image the area of cheekbones. It is useful test because atherosclerotic carotid disease is very common where common carotid artery bifurcates into external and internal branches.
768440	Hi dr...Can u please  duggest mmedications to help reduce blood pressure and reduce amount of protein in urine...	Reducing proteinuria BP medicines that reduce proteinuria (p) are ace-inhibitors, such as ramipril, angiotensin receptor blockers, valosartan, and direct renin inhibitors, aliskirin. Other drugs that do so are some calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem. Ask your doctor which is best for urine. Reduction of p is important to reduce cardiovascular side effects such as stroke, kidney failure and heart attacks.
219012	Can head CT w&wo contrast cause brain tumors?	Very little chance Because our understanding of radiation induced cancer is incomplete, it is assumed that any exposure to radiation increases the risk of developing cancer. This is called the non-threshold model. According to a recent nejm article the risk is approximately 0.005% at age 35 that a single ct brain would cause death due to cancer. N engl j med 2007; 357:2277-2284. The risk is even smaller at > age.
6771393	I just started taking maxzide  for hypertension and lexapro. I'm having headache and so nauseous. Would Benadryl be ok to help with the nausea?	OK but Benadryl is unlikely to relieve your nausea. If the drugs mentioned were recently introduced, make sure that your symptoms are not just side effects. In order to control the nausea, you will need to know what is causing it. Rx drug is often effective if necessary. If you suffer from migraine, then this is how it shows up.
943855	Igot my stool test done, the results are:- brown in color, semi solid and acidic(6-8), pus cells:2-4. Am i suffering from diarrhea or just an infection?	Stool culture From the information provided it is difficult to tell you if you have an infection. More important is the rult of your stool vulture.
1101008	How long after Depo-Provera provera will periods be normal? Last shot 8/01/13. Last period was 10/28/13. Almost two months. No possibility of pregnancy.	Variable There are many different things that contribute to how long after stopping depoprovera it takes for the ovaries to start working again and menses to resume. This includes how long a person has been taking the depoprovera, body size (fat stores the hormone), and baseline ovarian function. 2-3 months is pretty normal.
264217	Headache,  fever,  aches and pains all over. Fatigue,  very painful chest with cough.  Loads of phlegm being coughed up,  yellow/green in colour.?	Pneumonia Sounds like you have serious chest infection. See your doctor asap before your condition deteriorates any further.

1239386	Im in Zoloft 75mg Buspar 10mg twice ativan 1mg twice trazadon 50mg for sleep i steel feel deepresst can my doctor add Abilify 1mg  there any interacti?	Over Medicated In my experience when one is on this many medications all working on the brain adding one more medication is not going to help. In fact, you are on sedatives and sleeping medications at the same time and wondering why you are depressed? None of your meds are going to cure your anxiety. Isn't it time to re-assess the plan? You are depressed. The current medications are not working. Start there.
6767389	My son has severe poison ivy. He's on prednisone and Zyrtec as well as hydrocortisone cream. Nothing is working! He can't sleep and he's miserable. Can I give him benedryl if he had Zyrtec about 10 hrs ago?	Yes you can But don't exceed recommended dosage for his age, as for poison ivy, he needs to be re-evaluated, might need more steroids, or probably antibiotics if secondary infection developed, take care
1228007	Missed last active pill in birth control pack. Started new pack as normal after the inactive pills. Period was normal. Took Plan B . Pregnant?	Doubt it The last pill in the pack is the furthest away from the time of ovulation so the chance of pregnancy at that time was minimal, plus if you had your normal period, this supports you even more.
6774106	A small light brown spot appeared on my thigh a few of days ago. Does not hurt or itch and its not raised. Does not seem like a mole. What can it be?	Hard to say From what you describe it doesn't sound like a threat to your health. But for any rash/bump that is causing you great concern it's best to have your MD check it out. http://www.buzzle.com/articles/brown-spots-on-legs.html
1239389	Im taking zolof 75 trazadon 50 Buspar 10mg twice ativan twice i steel feel deepresst can I add Abilify 1mg because Abilify help me a lot?	See ur psychiatrist.

6730935	I have a throat that feels like mucous is in there and nose that has mucous but no runny nose, no cough, no fever, is it allergies? I'm not congested.	See doctor Probably not allergy . Apparently you have GERD which can cause this type of symptoms . You may consider a stronger acid suppression program after consulting with your doctor.
168581	Why do my knees hurt after playing sports?	Many possibilities Most likely it is due to overuse, but it could be due to a lot of different reasons. Knee pain can be due to gout, infection, or due to tendon, cartilage, or bone abnormalities. Have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment.

1579961	Small painless bump inside vagina, near inner labia, no itching, burning, or anything usual, should I be worried?	Not likely dangerous Could be a cyst from plugged gland. If not improving within a couple weeks, or if getting painful, then see a gynecologist or primary care doctor who does gynecology.

Complete You should have a complete skin cancer screening performed. This entails examining everywhere you have skin. I perform skin cancer screenings in addtion to sending my patients to a dermatologist. I feel the more eyes examining the skin the better.

1232959	Tody was my last day of cymbalta replace it in Zoloft senc 11day but to day i could not sleep i took ativan and trazadon but i steel can't sleep?	Don't understand... You don't say how much zoloft and when you are taking it--usually we would cross-taper--start someone on the zoloft and gradually be moving to a therapeutic dose and giving it some time as we move down on the cymbalta(in your case )--how much trazodone did you take, does it normally work for you? It typically takes time to get into one's system and begin to make one sleepy. Talk to your dr asap.
394334	Vaginal discharge missed period no pregnancy symptoms i haven't had a period since my last one ended on jan. 5th. I had unprotected sex on jan. 7th. I haven't had any symtoms of pregnancy but a lot of clear vaginal dischage that is sometimes yellow or whi	Since Since you have not gotten your period since your last one which ended on jan. 5th, and it is now feb. 24th, there is still a chance you are pregnant despite the multiple negative pregnancy tests. Please see your provider and have a blood pregnancy test which is more accurate. In addition, there should be cultures taken of your vaginal area because of your discharge. If you develop pain, fever, vomiting, or light-headedness, then you would need to be seen as an emergency.
371143	When can I hike after knee surgery? I need to go for arthroscopic knee surgery for meniscus repair. I'm planning a vacation in three months to do some moderate hiking. Am i being too optimistic about the recovery period?	That That is probably a bit on the optimistic side. This would be something to discuss with the surgeon of course. A meniscal repair as opposed to a debridement would require a much longer period of rest because you want to give the repair a chance to work before you go back to putting your knee to work. If the meniscus is debrided back to a stable border (and not repaired) then there is nothing that would keep you from getting back on the trails even before 3 months.
1446359	Pain bottom of foot. Calf and thigh cramping/knotting that wont go away. Could this be blood clot? I had a neg ultrasound knee to groin.	Plantar Fascitis? Where exactly "on the bottom of the foot".

You don't say what problem or symptoms you have. But with the extensive work-up so far, it sounds like something serious, like gastrointestinal bleeding or Crohn's disease.

389283	Can you spread the herpes virus through everyday activity not including sexual contact i recently found out i had the herpes virus. I have a 5 month old. I did not have it while pregnant. I have contracted it since being pregnant and I am worried i haven'	Cold Cold sores or fever blisters are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and are extremely common. Most people become infected as an infant or small child when kissed or by sharing eating utensils with an adult who has the virus. The virus is most contagious when someone has a cold sore, but can still be passed along by someone who does not. Many people do not even know that they are infected because the virus can "hide out" in the nerve cells for very long periods of time - for some people it hides out forever and they never get a cold sore. For others, the virus can "wake up" and that's when a cold sore happens. No one knows exactly what causes a cold sore to appear - sometimes stress, illness, fevers, colds, sunlight, cold weather, menstruation, certain foods, allergies, you name it! they usually last 7-10 days and are more of an annoyance than a danger unless you have a weakened immune system or contract a bacterial infection on top of the cold sore. Now, if you are concerned about genital herpes (typically caused by hsv-2, but can be caused by hsv-1), then your child's risk of catching it is extremely low if you contracted it after delivering her. It is spread through skin to skin contact of the infected area, so as long as she is not in contact with your genitals (like during delivery), she should be fine.

First of which is cervical bathing/coating by sperm.

Sperm deposited on the exterior of the vagina can't "migrate" into the vaginal canal.

402729	I have a lump infount of my ear  its getting bigger , is this cancer? Im asking now because im having pain , it goes through my neck to my right side of my head	Statistically Statistically this is more likely to be benign but much more information is needed to place you in a lower or higher risk category. Important historical information is knowing your age, how long it has been there, how big is the "lump", is it tender to touch?, is it fixed to the skin or can you freely move the skin over it?, is the skin over the lump red or warm?, is there a visible pore or opening over the lump?, any associated facial numbness or weakness?, what makes it better or worse?, has it been treated in any way and if so how and what was the response to treatment?. Questions like this help in stratifying your mass as likely inflammatory/infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, etc. I wish i could be more specific but i believe that any persistent mass/swelling should be looked at for a proper diagnosis and treatment and also to help alleviate your worries over it.

378351	I am six days late for my period. I took five pregnancy test and had a blood test and all came back negative, but I have swore breast nausea and white discharge.	If If you have had 5 negative pregnancy tests, including 1 negative blood test then the hormones that detect pregnancy are not present. The pregnancy hormone is detectable in the blood 11 days after conception. They are released by cells in the placenta which forms to nourish a fetus. Since these hormones are not detectable, then you are probably not pregnant. White vaginal discharge is not typically a sign of pregnancy. Hormonal changes and premenstrual symptoms can cause soreness of the breast, bloating, heachaches and mood changes.

When your son gets a bite, it itches. When he scratches it, the bacteria in the dirt under his nails get into the skin and cause the infection. The cure is to keep his nails cut short and keep him from scratching. You can use Hibicleanse wash to scrub his nails a couple of times a week too.
1237523	When i work out i get so tired and i just started lifting i drink water but i still get tired?	Tired Perhaps that is because there is an issue more complex than drinking water. Ask your doctor to check you out. Fatigue is a symptom of your body needing help.

For now, getting some sleep, avoiding bright lights, loud sounds, nsaids may help, but if you're a migraine sufferer i think it's worth it to try to find your triggering factors (e.g., food allergies) and then having a method to stave them off asap, rx or otherwise.

If If your sexual intercourse was very recent, this could be from the intercourse itself, with a combination of sperm and mucous. If your intercourse was more than 3 days ago, it could represent an infection, either sexually or non-sexually transmitted. If you used a condom it is unlikely to be sexually transmitted.

This being HealthTap and not a doctor's office, you won't get an answer to what it IS, but normal MRIs pretty much rule out MS and a normal EMG/NCS rules out a large-fiber neuropathy.

After playing soccer, i started feeling dizzy, then at least thirty minutes later i started feeling rapid beating in my chest but it was not my heart, then i got the chills. I have gone to the e.R three times and to a heart specialist	Hello. Hello. I wouldn't say not to worry yourself because obviously, you are very bothered by your symptoms. Since the doctors you have seen indicated that the episodes were likely panic attacks, this would be a good place to start. With panic attacks, you can become very anxious. You may have shortness of breath and feel chest tightness or pain. Often the heart rate is rapid and the heart beat may be pounding. Nausea is not uncommon. There can be tingling of fingertips or around the lips. You may get lightheaded or dizzy. You may feel like you need to get out of where ever you are at or fear that you are about to die. Panic attacks won't kill a person but they can be horrible. A panic attack is nothing to be embarassed about. It is just as much a medical problem as an ulcer or a broken leg. I am not diagnosing you. If that is what it is, it is treatable. Consider seeing a psychiatrist - right now your symptoms are hurting you quality of life.I am glad that you wrote in. Take care.

The severe pain was the stone passing.Once the pain is gone (and doesn't come back),it means the stone has passed into the bladder where it may break up or pass through the urethra which is painless.

6788436	Lymph nodes on right groin removed both benign. Recent skin infection right groin now swollen lymph node left groin. related even though diff sides?

The clearance of lymph on each leg is distinct from one another, so they should not be related. If you continue to have enlarged lymph nodes, you need to see a surgeon for more biopsies.

I have been having these random headaches that are sharp stabbing pain in the left temple area accompanied by dizziness, fatigue and slurred speech. I am only 28 and strokes aren't	To To begin, strokes are not that common a cause of headache, although it depends a bit on what is meant by "stroke". The majority of strokes are "infarcts", death of brain tissue from loss of blood supply, and these more often than not are not associated with headache. The other major kind of stroke is hemorrhage, and those often have headaches, often sudden and severe. Other causes of severe headache with neurological deficits such as slurred speech or dizziness can include brain tumors, brain vascular diseases such as vasculitis or arteriovenous malformations, or even leaking aneurysms. You should definitely see a neurologist to be evaluated for the cause of your symptoms and signs, and promptly, as these may be warning signs of a serious but treatable condition which, left alone, could be disabling or even fatal.

As you are concerned about pregnancy please take a test, and if you don't get your period in 2-3 days retake the test. But because of your cramping and discharge you do need an evaluation. If you develop pain, fever, or vomiting, then you would need to be seen as an emergency.
6714478	I had a shorter and lighter than normal period last week.  Ever since then I have had cramps, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, could i still be pregnant?	Not likely Probably not. Since you did still have somewhat of a period with bleeding and you are following up with typical period symptoms, I would be very very surprised if you were pregnant.

Unfortunately everthing that is painful does not show up on an mri. A 2-3cm popliteal cyst (bakers cyst) is usually not painful. I would suspect that you have either an articular cartilage injury or a meniscal tear that is not showing up on the mri.

Did you ever have symptoms in the past? Any involvement of your eyes? Was the positive CSF oligoclonal bands or elevated igg index? The information you presented best fits with a monsymptomatic presentation as defined by the mcdonald's criteria which was designed to define those individuals who are likely to develop ms. To secure the diagnosis you would need another clinical event or a change in your MRI after 3 months. They will probably want further testing including veps (visual evoked potentials) or oct (optical coherence tomography). The lab evaluation will include an ana, b12, folate, esr, vitamin d panel and routine labs. They may also want a MRI of the thoracic spine if the exam suggests spinal cord involvement. Good luck and well wishes.

It may be related to hormonal effects on water retention and the bowel.

This can often be treated with hormonal treatment, but in rare cases surgical intervention can be necessary.

They will hopefully be able to tell exactly what it is so you can get the proper treatment. Good luck!

URI It sounds like you have an upper respiratory tract infection. It may be viral, however, if it has gone on for longer than a week I would seek medical attention. Also, it is flu season.

My sister says she uses a neti pot to relieve sinus pressure. How effective are they and when should	If If symptoms are not improving or ameliorated within one week despite conservative measures such as a neti pot /sinus irrigation and decongestants, you probably should be seen. If the pain is progressing, or the drainage is purulent ( malodorous and pus-like) you should be seen sooner for initiation of antibiotic therapy. A neti pot will not treat an infectious cause for sinonasal complaints, it merely removes particulate and secretory matter, and often affords symptomatic relief for mild congestive/inflammatory symptoms.

I get it when digging many holes for bulbs/plants in the fall/spring.But see MD

Both would improve itchiness somewhat but not treating the inflammation due to contact dermatitis to your suspected poison ivy. Benadryl acts faster but it does not last as long.

If full lymph node dissection avoid that side at all cost use leg - calf any thing elsewhere as BP cuff used too high is worse then needle sticks done infrequently.

While While no physician can evaluate your mole without seeing it, the following clues (the abcde mnemonic) will help you determine if you should see your doctor: asymmetry: if you draw an imaginary line through the middle of your mole, both halves should look about the same. Moles that are asymmetric (unequal) are more likely to be cancerous. Border: most benign moles have smooth, distinct borders. Those that have uneven, hazy, or indistinct borders are more likely to be cancerous. Color: benign moles usually have a uniform pink, brown, or yellow color. Those with several shades of brown, black, blue, or red, or those that are jet black or blue-black are more worrisome. Diameter: most benign moles are smaller in diameter than a standard pencil eraser. Evolution: any mole that bleeds, changes color or shape, itches, or otherwise causes concern should be evaluated by your physician. Hope that helps!

The good news is that most people recover with non-surgical treatment, though it can take a very long time. Treatments typically include: - rest - bed rest is not recommended after 1-2 days, but avoiding activities such as lifting for the first week after injury can be helpful. - ice and heat - ice in the first 2-3 days can help decrease swelling. Heat after that can increase blood flow and mobility to the area - anti-inflammatory medications such as alieve (naproxen) or Motrin (ibuprofen) not only provide pain relief, but help with swelling in the area - physical therapy and exercise - probably one of the most effective ways of treating back pain i've added a helpful link to a website written by the national institute for health that gives more in-depth information on back injury. If your symptoms are not improving after 72 hours of treatment at home, or if you have worsening numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control, contact your doctor immediately.

Yes, Yes, men are succeptible to urinary tract infections (uti). The urethra and bladder are sterile environments. And if any bacteria/fungus/virus/foreign substance is introduced into the urethra, an infection can occur. Also, the discharge you are seeing can indicate an std or other infection. Blood in urine could occur as a result of trauma or a medical condition. Throughout the genitilia, there are many areas and blood vessels that could be broken, leading to blood in the urine or semen. Items that could cause trauma and blood in the urine could be aggressive sex or masterbation, interrupted sex, kidney stones, prostatitis or a procedural biopsy on the testicles/kidney/bladder. Medical conditions that can cause blood in the urine include: side effects of blood thinners, stds such as chlamydia/genital herpes/warts, prostate cancer or bladder cancer. Since this is an ongoing condition for your boyfriend, it is suggested that he see his doctor to determine what the cause is. If there is an infection or trauma going on, it is important to get it assessed.

However there are many women who have presented with breast cancer that they have discovered by self exams. Ultrasound is very helpful to assess breast lumps, abnormal shadows on a mommogram or generally lumpy breasts. A clinical breast exam also needs to be done annually (or more frequently if needed) even if your mammogram is reported normal.

You may have necrotic ( dead) skin and tissue just below the surface that can be infected easily leading to more issues. While many bites do not lead to this amount of severe problems, the bite that get worse a few days ater is something to be concerned about. Special topical medications, surgery and prolonged treatment for a wider bigger area of skin and tissue necrosis ( translate skin and soft tissue death) can result if this progresses. That being said, not all spider bites are brown recluse bites but if it is not getting better, its better to be evaluated.

The skin is drying up and that makes it more painful, I have tried pure aloe vera plant g	I'm I'm sorry you're having troubles with this rash. There are several conditions that cause facial rashes, and sometimes it's necessary to have a physician evaluate your rash to distinguish one cause from another. The "malar rash" of lupus (an autoimmune disease) typically involves the cheeks and the bridge of your nose; sometimes the eyelids are also involved.This rash can be very scaly and tender, and it tends to get worse with sun exposure or stress. Rosacea, a chronic skin disorder whose cause is unknown, can also cause scaling, blistering, and swelling. Its distribution differs slightly from the malar rash of lupus (see link below). Rosacea typically involves a broader area of the face, including the chin, cheeks, forehead, and nose. Your eyes can also be affected. People with rosacea tend to be "blushers." seborrheic dermatitis is a condition that causes redness and flaking of the face (eyelids, eyebrows, creases beneath the nose) and scalp. Other body regions can also be affected. The rash of seborrhea tends to be red, oily and flaky. Contact dermatitis is caused by sensitivity to irritating substances, such as essential oils, harsh soaps, and certain cosmetics. This rash, which can be red, blistery, and flaky, occurs in areas where sensitizing substances have been applied. Treatment for these conditions differs. For example, corticosteroid creams (such as hydrocortisone) may improve contact dermatitis, but they can worsen rosacea; the malar rash of lupus usually resolves when the lupus is treated; and so on. If your rash hasn't cleared and you haven't seen your doctor yet, i suggest you do so. Good luck! http://www.Healthy-skin-guide.Com/rosacea-a-symptom-of-lupus.Html.

The problem with MRI scans of the spine is that they are good at identifying structural changes but do not let us know what is causing the pain. The changes you note on the MRI are common age associated changes. I suggest you see a physical medicine & rehab doctor (non-surgeon) who specializes in the spine.

See a doctor Very difficult to judge the cause based on what you say. Every new or uneplained increased vaginal discharge needs medical care if the cause isn't obvious. As you suggest yourself, possibilities include STDs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas) if you're at risk (and many 21 yr old women are). Yeast and bacterial vaginosis also are possible. See your doctor. Good luck!

My daughter has just discovered she is pregnant for the second time. Her first pregnancy 5 years ago ended up with a 3 wee	Yes Yes her 2nd pregnancy will be considered high risk as it sound like she had pre-eclampsia or what some will call toxiemia. Her doctor will monitor her closely for signs of elevated BP and proteinuria and also make sure that if she has gestational diabetes, that she is treated and monitored for it. About 3 percent of women have pre-eclampsia and 7 percent have gestional diabetes with pregnancy so it is common enough that most ob/gyn doctors are comfortable managing patients with who end up having high blood pressure or diabetes in pregnancy.

You should have a repeat physical exam - the best treatment for biceps strain is initial rest followed by stretching and strengthening exercises.

Not necessarily Vestibular nerve section is reserved for meniere's patients who have severe attacks of vertigo that persist despite maximal medical therapy and who still have good hearing levels in the affected ear. Usually the patient has also tried and failed intratympanic steroid injections to try to improve the episodes of vertigo.

Yeast is a good bet These are typical symptoms of candida vulvovaginitis, i. e. a vaginal yeast infecttion. If your symptoms were mild, it might be OK to try an over-the-counter yeast cream like Monistat and others. But other conditions are possible and these symptoms sound pretty severe. I would recommend you see your doctor, both for diagnosis and to make sure there's not an underlying health problem, like diabetes.
1375903	I had a small painless bump in labia minora with pus.One week ago I popped it and now it hasn't gone yet although I applied bacroban and betadine.

Your doctor can expl The doctor you have seen already can explain why he is sending you to a neurologist. It may be just for treating your migraine. On the other hand he may have noticed some neurologic signs to be concerned about. I would not worry about any tumors unless they have done complete testing and told you more. Brain tumors are quite rare and would have much more in the way of symptoms than you have.

My symptoms are, dizziness, lightheaded, i feel loss of balance, i feel weak and tired have trouble concentrating, have tingling in my head when it hurts. B	Headaches Headaches and their causes can be complicated, difficult diagnoses to make. Since it is waking you up at night, you should make an appointment with your doctor for a complete evaluation. You doctor will take a thorough history and do a neurological evaluation to try and find out what is causing your symptoms. You may want to think about the answers to some of the questions they may ask you such as: - when did it start? - how often do they happen? - are they getting more frequent or more painful? - how long do they last? - what does the headache feel like and can you point to it? - does it occur around the same time at night or does it ever happen during the day? - what other symptoms do you have and when do they occur in regards to the headache? - have you had any big life changes? - how is your lifestyle? Are you getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising? - are you taking any medications? Do you drink caffeine and how much? Answering these questions may help your doctor figure out what is causing your headaches, whether it is a serious problem or not, and how to help you. Good luck!
386024	Do i need a pet scan after surviving breast cancer? I had breast cancer (stage 1) and treatment was successful.  I just had a mammogram and there was no cancer.  Treatments were chemotherapy and radiation.	PET Pet scans are not proven to be of use in stage i breast cancer. There is a new type of breast-only pet canning called pem zthat is currently being tested, but right now there it also has no established role in monitoring you for recurrence or a new cancer. Glad to hear the mammo was clear and wish you the best. For now an annual mammo, possibly with an ultrasound, is the best testing after treatment for an early stage breast cancer. There are some woman with a particularly higher risk of recurrence or of developing a second new tumor who will also benefit from regular MRI scans. Ask your doctors if they think you need this too.
602254	Went to doc. Had pregnant urine test. Positive. Blood test result: 4147 (#) <3 mlu/ml: neg 3-8 mlu/ml: may indicate early preg. What does it mean?	Not sure I can't tell if your HCG level is falling or rising, and I don't understand "may indicaate early pregnancy. ". I suggest you ask your doctor for a repeat blood test at the same laboratory. If viable, it will rise. A falling level would mean a non-viable pregnancy. Then you will know what is going on.

512995	I have pain in my left shoulder up a lil toward my neck and a burning sensation. What can this be some times pain takes over my intire arm.?	Neurologic problem Your symptoms sound like a cervical (neck) nerve root problem. A cervical radiculopathy often presents as neck pain with radiation into the upper extremity.

629138	2 weeks late. Negative blood & urine test at 9 days late. Several pregnancy symptoms. Could I have just ovulated late & been too early to tell if i was pregnant by the tests?	Trust the test Home pregnancy tests are very accurate. They are the same tests used in a doctors office. They can detect a pregnancy 7-10 days after conception. The best time to take one is when you miss your period. If you doubt the result you can repeat it in 1-2 days. If you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection.
644867	Is is possible for a woman that had a total hysterectomy due to endometriosis 12 yrs ago now have this inside the stomach if it was "caked" to uterine wall? Taken estro/progestine patches since then.	Yes, but... Yes but if there is something there that is measurable on some image it is important to make sure it is not cancer. Women with endometriosis in their lifetime have a higher risk of ovarian and peritoneal cancer which can still occur many years after a total hysterectomy. That is not to scare you but just to make sure you get properly evaluated.
1261730	I have red pimple like bumps all over my body. They are extremely itchy and hurt. I have never had them until the last two weeks. What could they be?	Urticaria 50% of the time we never find out what the allergen is. It usually goes away by itself.

1248720	After my period ended. I still feel nauseous, cramping, swollen sore breasts, and headaches. Period was early and light. What could this be?	Pregnancy test? It's always a good idea to take a pregnancy test if you have had unprotected sex and your period is early, late, too light, or different. If the test is negative (and if last sex was more than 14 days ago), then your symptoms could be from something else, like an ovarian cyst, or just a hormonal fluctuation.
755891	Had flu and throat infection january, one swollen tonsil since, swollen gland same side sometimes, ulcer on tonsil for last 2 days is this cancer?	Unlikely Most cancers of the oral cavity and throat are painless and have no symptoms until fairly late in the disease. Lymphomas (a cancer of the lymph nodes) can enlarge nodes and the tonsils but won't often ulcerate. More likely this is an infection, so see your doctor asap about whether you need antibiotics. He/she can judge if you fail to respond and then think of other diagnoses.

1509551	I have a severe allergy to ibuprofen as well as aspirin. Is vicodin safe to take for a serious migraine?	Very like so As ibuprofen and aspirin fit under the NSAIDs(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), so it isn't uncommon if you are allergic to aspirin to be allergic to motrin, ibuprofen, aleve, naprosen. Vicodin contains hydrocodone and acetaminphen, neither which usually cross react with the previously mentioned drugs. But opioid containing drugs are not ideal for migraine management. Talk with your doc
6767141	Sore throat/laryngitis/low grade fever has not improved in one week.  Went to urgent care and got amoxicillan 4 days ago.  Do I need to go back?	Not yet... Finish out your prescription and if the symptoms do not drastically improve, go back to the doc. If your fevers suddenly become worse, I would get checked sooner.
1437140	How is a biopsy taken of a palpable breast lump if it doesn't show up in ultrasound or mammogram? Wondering how they accurately guide the needle?	They can do it by palpation. Another imaging option is Breast MRI. It is highly sensitive for carcinoma. If it is negative, you may not need a biopsy. If it is positive, biopsy could be performed with MRI guidance.
927146	Had m/c in july&have been having sex now am having sore breast, cramps, weight gain.Went for urine test&was negative but confused because of the symptom?	Hormones If the pregnancy test was negative and yet you are having those symptoms of pregnancy, it's possible the symptoms are due to hormonal changes. Or it's possible you're weakly positive and it just hasn't shown up yet. If you've missed a period, take another test. If you haven't missed a period, wait until you do and then take a test. Good luck!

You can get gonorrhea or syphilis or infectious mono or CMV. But not HIV. Very few people are bleeding, especially while you're kissing them. I'm very glad you found a time to be happy with another person, and that you're comfortable with who you are -- and I admire your courage in asking. Love well and safely. Best wishes.

A pregnancy test may be the first place to start. If that is negative, a more in-depth history and physical will be necessary, including blood work to check your blood counts, your electrolytes, and possibly a thyroid study. You may also have a form of gastroenteritis, which is inflammation or infection of the stomach and intestines. Hope you feel better!

386393	1 ovary and fallopian tube..What are my chances of concieving? I'm 27 and have only 1 ovary and fallopian tube..They are on the same side. I got pregnant 4 years ago and miscarried. I had to have a dnc. Now i can't seem to get pregnant anymore. I'm worrie	I I agree with dr moffit. I would like to some other thoughts. I think that the reason for having a single tube and ovary could provide us with some insight into the likelihood of internal scar tissue or other factors that could be a problem. Since you had a pregnancy even though it was a miscarriage, you probably have a reasonably normal tube and ovary. When you lost your ovary, you lost 50% of the eggs in your body at that time. We know that there is a relationship between the number of eggs in your body and your fertility potential. So, women with a single ovary are likely to enter menopause earlier than usual and thus also lose their fertility potential earlier. There are not too many studies that quantitate this fact but one study (melica f et al.; 1995) showed that when the ovary was removed before the age of 30 then menopause occurred on average at age 45 versus age 50. Other studies show that women with a single ovary have reduced fertility earlier. The good news is that you are only 27 years old and therefore you likely have good fertility remaining now and some time. But my message to you would be to not wait too long to get care. Your problem is one that would benefit from a consultation with a fertility specialist. I would do that sooner for the reasons that i stated but your age gives me great hope for your success. Good luck.

Fevers for the most part aren't dangerous and are just the body's natural reaction to fighting off an infection. Most of these infections are viral and may be accompanied by runny nose, sore throat, congestion, mild rash, or nothing at all. Since fevers aren't dangerous, we usually treat the fever with Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen just to make the child more comfortable as their body fights the illness. "red flags" that we look for with fever to indicate something more serious is going on are: -fevers that last 5 days or more -fevers persistently above 104f orally -a child that acts very sick - very irritable or difficult to wake -difficulty breathing -vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to drink, or dehydration -a purple rash, esp on the legs -stiff neck -any complaints of pain such as the ear, throat, stomach or a joint as always, use your judgement.

Check a pg test to be sure, anytime your period is abnormal, in length, symptoms, or timing. Repeat in a week and if negative, and you miss another period, see your doc to find out why. Follow the instructions on the kit, and be sure it has not expired, too. Also, infections can occur, if you are at risk of pregnancy. So get checked for those if your pg test is negative. Practice safe sex!

849050	Last sex 5.05. On 8.06 i took blood test hCG beta hormon level 7, 6. After seven days i made home pregnancy test it was negative. I'm i pregnant?	Don't think so. The beta HCG level of 7 is very low- if a urine pregnancy test was negative 7 days later then it sounds like your hormone levels declined after the 8. 06 test -instead of increasing, as they should have with a normally progressing pregnancy. There is a small chance of getting a false negative home pregnancy test and you could check it again or get another beta check to be sure. But most likely not.

URI You are in the midst of an upper respiratory infection. The productive cough indicates there is moderate phlegm inside your lungs. Drink lots of water to help thin it out.

See an MD soon to make sure it's in recovery. http://www.pdrhealth.com/diseases/cough

591033	Is there is any oils like eruvamatin which helps in the growth of hair in bald head?	Not likely to help One's primary care doctor can check for medical causes.

Calluses Calluses are a build up of the superficial layers of Keratin in an area of excessive mechanical stress or pressure (usually the skin is getting shear or entrapment from the underlying bones). The callus, itself, probably does not itch. There is likely an irritation of an underlying nerve. Alternatively, you may have a fungal infection. If the problem persists or worsens, see a Podiatrist.

Ok but If you have used it only 5 x in 2 weeks, it'd be fine. Nasal saline sprays also reduce allergic inflammation and likely wash off some of the allergens deposited on the nose.

Distal polyneuropath Skin biopsy is useful for detection of peripheral neuropathy predominantly affecting small unmyelinated nerve fibers, likley ruled out in your case.

See answer If you have orofacial or genital herpes (hsv-1/hsv-2), you cannot transmit the infection to another part of your body after initial infection occurs. That said, with genital herpes, one has infection of the l-4, l-5, and s-1 nerve roots which innervate the rectal area, buttocks and lateral aspect of the thigh and so outbreaks can occur in those areas. Shingles can affect any area of the body.

Please see your doctor if tiredness and weight gain are your main concerns.

Do you mean your testicular size is basically the same before and after a bout of orchitis. Remember while swelling can and often is seen in cases of orchitis, a significant size change doesn't have to always be noted. Sometimes beyond swelling, the lack of a uniform appearing testis(heterogeneity) and increased vascular flow(hypervascularity) suggest orchitis on US

Many possibilities When the body itches all over, it implies that the itching/rash may be a reaction from an ingestion such as a medication or food, or an allergy to the environment, ie hayfever.

You had hepatitis Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.. so yes you DO have hepatitis. So chemical, bacterial, viral and autoimmune could be the problem. As you mentioned AST, ALT and GGT are the liver enzymes monitored and are specific and sensitive markers. ESR is a very very non-specific tool that is not exclusively tied to liver inflammation. The important thing is that the liver numbers normalized.

Doesn't sound female Your symptoms for heart problems sound more like a man's than woman's. Most women's symptom are a feeling of indigestion or heartburn. Did you do any heavy lifting or slept in a funny position. Does the pain go away with meds like ibuprofen? Look at what you may have done to tweek your muscles on that side. Perhaps lifting a child or pet could do that. Don't live with it and get second opinion.
1338290	What red, raised, itchy rash develops right after swimming in a chlorinated public pool? It's only on chest and shoulders. Treatment ideas?

Meniscal injury Honestly, it sounds a whole lot like the symptoms that are commonly reported with meniscal tears or strains.

See a physician Unless you have a previous problem that explains why you need a crutch for a bad hip, that is reason alone to seek medical attention. The newer joints affected certainly suggests an inflammtory type arthritis such as rheumatoid. At 37, you should not be having these issues and you need to have a full evaluation. Start with your family physician or see a rheumatologist sooner then later.
61087	Could surgery remove the ovarian cysts?	Yes if needed Surgery can remove ovarian cysts, but they can also return even after surgery. Laparoscopic surgery can be used in some cases, and i believe that there may be medications that your gynecologist may try (hormones). Many types of ovarian cysts can also resolve on their own, unless they are very large.

Possibly Persons may develop allergic antibodies to the componets of wine (grape) or beer (barley, rye, hops) or even to the brewer's yeast. Some are also sensitive to the perservatives used such as sulfites. Un-sulfited wine is available in most wine shops.

564196	What could cause my emg of my right leg to show significant nerve damage, but the MRI of my back to be normal? I've had no injuries to either area..	Right leg only? If i understand, the abnormal findings are in only one leg. Could be a mono neuritis multiplex, but how about a lesion in the sciatic nerve such as a piriformis syndrome. Diabetics can get metabolic unilateral radiculopathies (amyotrophies). A search for the true location and causation can be indeed very fruitful.
360843	I have pain directly above the knee by 2cm with some swelling.It occurred 1year ago&i was unable to walk.Pain also in leg below knee but can walk now.?	See doctor This is a problem that necessitates a face-to-face meeting with your doctor. This will allow him/her to examine you, ask specific questions.

Hard to know w/o MRI Honestly, it is really very hard to know that it is even at L4/5 without an MRI. I assume you maybe had one in the past (?) based on your described diagnosis of scoliosis and sacroiliitis. Neuropathy is not usually from scoliosis or even L4/5 disc disease, so you might have something else. I would recommend an MRI of the lumbar spine without contrast if you really want to know for sure about L4/5.
6780057	I'm pregnant 4-5 weeks unsure. Started bleeding 2 days ago bright red blood but not heavy or painful now stopped. Is this a miscarriage?

Pain is possible but it will be difficult to blame your discs.

CNS Only 2 major concerns: 1) general impact on level of consciousness making you tired or sleepy, less coordinated, thereby affecting your function including driving. Timing of when you take each med affects this, but after 3 months, you should notice if this concern is significant. 2) lower seizure threshold. Unless you have a seizure disorder, family history, or drink alcohol, this is minor.

She said my TSH was low can I conceive with those numbers & progesterone was 8.5 is that ok?	Ovulation Usually like for your day 21 Progesterone to be greater than 10. If this was done on day 21 needs to be repeated next month or consider Clomid and or thyroid work up. Hope this helps

Normal finding I am amazed about how often I have women ask me about the veins on their breast. Occasionally they are spider veins but mostly they are blue veins. These are almost always normal findings and normal variations of chest veins. They tend to be more pronounced in fair skinned females and they may be related to hereditary factors or even pregnancies. No treatment is necessary unless for cosmetics.
1513669	2weeks prior dehydration in hospital.now nausea,fatigue, pain in back under right rib cage, stomach cramps, bloating, gas, floating stools. AnyAnswer?	Be seen again You may have to be seen again to determine cause. Unfortunately, sometimes people can even pick up new things in the hospital while they are being treated such as pseudomembranous colitis which can produce symptoms similar to what you are describing. I would encourage you to be seen.
370741	Are mammograms as good for small breasted women? Does the effectiveness of a mammogram decrease if you have small breasts?	No, No, breast size generally does not affect the sensitivity of the mammogram. Breast density on the other hand, can affect the sensitivity of mammography. Breasts are made up of both fat and glandular tissue. If the breasts are mostly fatty, it is easier to detect a small tumor. Breasts that have a high percentage of glandular tissue and are very dense can easily hide small tumors. Breast implants can also make mammogram evaluation more difficult; for this reason, additional views are obtained on women who have breast implants (displaced implant views).
1502765	My dad accidentally took 1 hydrocodone pain right after taking 2 advil, Is that okay?	Shouldn't be problem but am not sure how you "accidentally" take a hydrocodone pill. Unless your father is very sick, or is on other central nervous system depressants, a single hydrocodone (which until Zohydro came out contains no more than 10 mg of hydrocodone) should not cause major problems. Medications should always be in their original bottles, and labels should ALWAYS be carefully read before taking ANY med.
175894	What's the best OTC medication for nasal congestion due to sinusitis infection?	Pseudoephedrine The best treatment for a bacterial sinus infection is antibiotics - to kill off the infection and let the sinuses heal. For viral infections, decongestants can help with the symptom of nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine, available without a rx from your pharmacist, works best, but often produces significant side effects. Oxymetazoline nasal spray also works well, but don't use it for more than a wk.

1592844	Have really bad nose congestion and I took one Claritin d non drowsy. I am starting to feel really tired, is this normal? Also, there isnt much relief	Probably a cold. Probably a cold and only time will make it go away. The claritin d is only for allergy and some runny nose. Time will make you feel better and you might ask the pharmacist or your doctor the recommendations of over the counter cold preparations that is safe for you to take.
6654223	Left abdominal pain. Pelvis and vaginal ultrasound clear.Had abdominal CT and it showed 3.5 cm uterine fibroid.Should I worry since the US missed it?	Diagnostic tests are never 100%.

It has been on my left big toe for 2 years, now it is showing up on my right big toe! my mom and dad look at it but don't know what and they keep telling me we will go	I I can't diagnose you over the internet, but if you've had it for 2 years, and it's now appearing in the same spot on the other big toe, it could be irritation from rubbing because of the shape of your toe or even that your shoe size needs to be increased. While there is no real rush, mom and dad should take you to a podiatrist. Print this out and leave it on the kitchen counter: dear mom and dad of anonymous kid from lansing, mi: your child seems to be concerned enough to write here at avvo about a problem he or she is having in their big toes. My best advice is to take him or her to a podiatrist and find out whether this is anything serious. Besides, he/she is in pain. Sincerely, dr. Fox in ny hope that helps kiddo. Good luck!

6761148	I just need a prescription for acyclovir , i have herpes simplex virus 1 one and my doctor gave me a prescription for it with 4 refills and i lost it?	2 options Your options depend upon what's happened thus far. If you already left your prescription at your pharmacy and lost the medications, just go back to pharmacy for early refill (although insurance may not pay). If you lost actual prescription, call doctor's office for new one. Since acyclovir isn't a controlled substance, I don't foresee an issue. Many docs use electronic prescribing so can't lose it
1166431	I have just very little urine and pressure on my bladder. I also have tenderness in my lower abdomen. Could this be a uti?	Yes Infection of the bladder can give someone several symptoms including need to void frequently, urgency and burning on urination.

6761143	Recurring large amount of dark rectal bleeding Inc. Large Blood clots. Colonoscopy showed only internal hemorrhoid. OK to assume blood only due to it?	Unlikely The bleeding is probably from diverticulosis or something known as an arterio-venous malformation (AVM). Since these can be anywhere in the colon, if surgery is ever needed to remove that section, it is important to find the exact location with a variety of imaging tests, usually only helpful during a bleeding episode. Hope this helps!

Maybe If it is just some redness due to the trauma of popping the bump, it should fade over the next few months.

Classic pregnancy symptoms can begin as early as when you miss your period. You can test with a routine home pregnancy test as soon as the first day you miss your period.

We cannot give you a definite answer without examining you, though. See a doc.
6717033	Hit my knee cap hard is now swelled, bruised and hurts to touch around the knee cap. Hit it on a corner of a bench should I have it looked at?	Knee Cap to Nite Cap If you can't walk or extend your knee, get it looked at now. But if you can walk and the pain is confined to the knee cap, bets are good that it's just bruised and will get better. Hitting any boney prominence (elbow, ankle, knee, ribs) hurts a lot and can hurt for quite a while. If you just bumped it I wouldn't worry too much It takes a lot of force to crack a kneecap. Give it two weeks.
92278	My daughter still has the lymph nodes of the left side of her neck very swollen, and the lump of the front of the ear big, CT scan was done but no ans?

More importantly you could be dealing with a cardiac (heart) issue. Things like coronary artery disease could be a factor.

-my second period was dec. 31 and it lasted til jan. 2
-my third period was jan.	As As doctors, the first thing we do when we hear that a young, fertile woman is having a missed period or abnormal spotting, we check a pregnancy test. You can either take a home pregnancy test as long as it has been 5- 6 weeks since your last normal period, or you can go see your doctor and they can test you. A home pregnancy test is 97% accurate if taken a week or more after the missed period. Depending on when you took your home tests, it may have been too early for an accurate reading. A blood test can tell if you are pregnant as soon as 7 days after conception and a doctor's urine pregnancy test can tell if you are pregnant around when you next period should come. There are other reasons besides pregnancy that can cause a woman to miss a period such as: stress, diet, excessive exercise or a hormone imbalance such as with a thyroid disorder or polycystic ovarian syndrome. If you are not pregnant and are still worried about an irregular cycle, give your doctor a call. Your doctor will take a thorough history and physical and may run some tests to find out why your period is irregular. This is especially important if you are trying to become pregnant since problems that effect your period also effect your fertility. Good luck!

1229398	Exercising squats is good if you have knee injury? Or it will worsen the injury?	Depends If the injury is to the front of the knee (patella area) squats can actually increase the pain.

1375769	Brown mole, recently had small bump under, used to be flaky, now bleeding a lot, is it melanoma?

Are you picking at it so it bleeds? At your age a melanoma is a rare possibility but an irritated mole is much more likely. If you have any doubt- see a dermatologist for analysis.

Anxiety is often associated with an elevated heart rate; with panic attacks, heart rate can be markedly elevated. Also, people can become hyperaware, making it worse. Rarely, medical conditions may cause high stress hormone levels, unlikely but sometimes worth checking.
1492222	Should i see a doctor about anxiety if i get random chest pressure/pain and heart palpitations from time to time? always think im pregnant even if not	Yes I think you should see PCP. Those symptoms can be from anxiety disorder if the clinical scenario fits well but organic causes- including cardiac (heart) - should be excluded first.

Even if it was confirmed to be anxiety related, a better control can be achieved for those sympt

832252	Can anxiety give you a heart attack or heart problem? I can't exercise because i get shaky, weak short of breath during and fear it's my heart.	Anxiety & the heart Anxiety is the feeling that derives from your brain detecting danger and causing you to fight and flee. That will cause your heart rate to increase, blood pressure to rise, and breathing to become more rapid and shallow (among other things). The symptoms become a new danger as you fear a heart problem.Rarely it will cause that and almost never at your age.Focus on the cause of anxiety not symptoms.
1449442	I had to go to the ER today for a panic attack n they injected me with 1mg of ativan is it okay to go ahead n take my .5mg of Xanax now?	Probably. The half-life of ativan is about 10 to 20 hours, so there may still be avian in your system. Usually, xanax is prescribed for control of symptoms similar to panic attacks. If you were currently having symptoms, it probably would be useful for you. If you were going to take it, just to stay on some type of schedule, not for symptoms, then you can probably skip a dose.

And what the defined details regarding these injuries are. If your employer allows yo to do work a t a reduced rate, perhaps they will have you come back sooner. If they demand you cannot work without a cast and you need one then that'll take time too. A lot of this is individualized to the injury and the employer and the treatment plan.

Chronic pain Some infections and some medicines can turn on the nerves that carry pain impulses and, once sensitized, they don't turn off easily. Your vagina itself is probably fine and there are meds for this type of problem. You need to see an OB/GYN and preferably one with an interest in pelvic pain.
1365765	I fell in feb on knees. Surgeon says it caused chondromalacia. Another surgeon reviewed notes & says it was preexisting. Who do I believe?	Does it matter?? Chondromalcia of the knee or more probably the patella (knee cap) can be present with little or no symptoms. A fall can make this condition clinically painful or symptomatic. I take it that you may have some legal concerns about the fall and whether it was responsible for your symptoms after the fall. Some conditions can be present but not cause any symptoms until after an injury.

If your usual family doctor isn't helpful for this you may consider visiting a ear nose and throat specialist.

Thus any symptoms before a missed period are not pregnancy symptoms.

Depo and menses The depo shot makes the lining thin and is a hormone injection that lasts up to 3 months. In some patients, it may last a bit longer so it appears you may be one of them. It may take a while until your body adjusts back to normal. I would monitor the bleeding and see your doctor if it doesn't come and you are not pregnant.
373274	Does an angioplasty cure coronary artery disease? Will I have to have repeat angioplasties, or does this procedure prevent plaque from forming again?	The The bad news: nothing cures coronary disease. Once you develop "hardening of the arteries" it follows you for life. The good news: with modern management it can become a chronic stable condition. Measures to consider are smoking cessation, diet, exercise and control of high blood pressure and diabetes if present. You will need to be on many pills including a statin. Even then we are talking statistics. Modern stents for example, are 95% effective which means that some people fall in the 5% group. Doing the right things minimize your chances of having to go back in the cath lab or worse.

Monitoring Centers Lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food. Lymph nodes "taste" the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers, etc. When it detects a problem, it alerts the immune system and your body reacts. They enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react. They shrink when all is well.

Possible sinusitis Pain above and below the eye with cough ; congestion suggests sinusitis. An ear infection is likely present as well. Initial treatment with Ibuprofen and decongestants may be helpful, but if not much improved you should see your doctor. The rib pain might be related to cough trauma, but the arm pain cause is not clear. Another reason to see your doctor.

If you've not been seen by any doctor then, I highly recommend and urge that you get seen for a preliminary examination to make sure nothing of an organic nature (especially cardiac wise) is possibly contributing to your symptoms.

An Ob-Gyn doctor can evaluate any persistent or worrisome symptoms.
393194	If you have a normal pap does that mean you don't have the HPV virus anymore? Can the virus go away if you still have warts?	HPV Hpv or human papilloma virus is a family of related viruses that infect humans but cause different problems. Some hpv types can cause genital warts, but the hpv types that can cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer. Hpv is the cause of 70% of cervical cancer globally. There are about 40 types of hpv that can infect the genitals or sex organs of men and women - the hpv types that are associated with changes on a womanâ€™s cervix that can lead to cervical cancer include types 16 and 18, which are generally acknowledged to cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. Just having the hpv itself is not the same as cervical cancer as many women have hpv. Few of them get cervical cancer if they follow their doctorâ€™s advice for screening and/or treatment. Hpv can infect the normal cells on your cervix to turn abnormal. Over many years, abnormal cells can turn into cancer if they are not found and treated by your doctor. It can take 10 to 15 years (or more) for cells to change from normal to abnormal, and then into cancer. Abnormal cells are sometimes called â€œpre-cancerâ€ because they are not normal, but they are not yet cancer. The pap test is a screening test for cervical cancer. It looks for abnormal cells on your cervix that could turn into cancer over time. That way, problems can be found and treated before they ever turn into cancer. Recently, a quadrivalent vaccine against hpv 6, 11, 16 and 18 has been shown to prevent infections and the cervical changes associated with them for those virus subtypes included in the vaccine. The effectiveness is nearly 100% in preventing new hpv 16 or 18 infections, which have been associated in more than 50% of cervical cancers. While there has been political controversy about the use of hpv vaccination before onset of sexual activity, the recommendations from the medical community support vaccination.

Shouldn't be often I don't know of clinical studies that addressed this - maybe another doctor here does - my educated guess is that it shouldn't be often. Remember most ectopics are diagnosed by combination of abnormal quants and ultrasound, so you'd need abnormal quants plus a cyst to mis-diagnose. The reverse, mistaking an ectopic for a cyst, would be more plausible.

X-ray can help Hello Sean, If there is a polyp large enough to cause an obstruction or large blockage then yes, an X-ray could definitely help in making the diagnosis. Feces can be seen on a 'Scout film of the abdomen' above the blockage. The doctor may look for Air-Fluid levels.

The cervix is the opening to the uterus, which is normally connected to the fallopian tubes where fertilization normally takes place.

Diagnosing ectopic That ultrasound report is not very helpful. It's usually impossible to see a gestational sac at 4.5 weeks. Making the diagnosis of ectopic may require serial blood tests to watch the HCG hormone levels rise, and repeat ultrasounds. As a guideline, when your HCG level reaches about 1200, you should be able to see a tiny gestational sac in the uterus. Good luck!

Pregnancy tests are available at any pharmacy and in minutes you will have your answer. They can detect a pregnancy 7-10 days after conception. The best time to take one is when you miss your period.

Could be It is not feasible to provide a meaningful opinion without taking additional history, physical examination and may be some tests. He should see his doctor. You should get HPV vaccination. If you do not wish to be pregnant, use contraception all the time, every time. You may consider implanted contraceptive, or IUD. Practice safe sex.
1163920	Is it normal for my cheek to be very swollen due to muscle spasms?  I have no infection, my dentist said it was due to a high bite caused by a filling	No The high bite will usually result in pain before you would get muscle hypertrophy resulting in a more prominent 'cheek' appearance. It is possible that you have transient swelling from the anesthesia needle placement possibly causing a temporary hematoma (swelling/bruise).This is more common in anesthesia for upper back tooth restorations. Get the bite corrected. Meantime use hot moist compresses.
312620	I have been having thin milky discharge (not lumpy, no oder), and painful bumps around the edge of my vagina. Is this a yeast infection or std?	Could be Usually yeast is itchy. Std would depend on your sexual history. If it does not itch or smell it could also be physiologic leukorrhea which is normal lubrication discharge, more common in younger women. The bumps may or may not be related. See a doctor for diagnosis or reassurance.
201165	Can a doctor to determine if someone is still contagious with mono?	Sometimes The most infectious period of mononucleosis is within the first few weeks of the illness. As you feel better and your antibodies rise against the epstein barr virus (ebv), you become less contagious. However, ebv remains in the body for life. At times the virus may be shed when you are well and at times it can be passed on with a recurrence of illness. The contagious period is indefinite.

396859	Knee pain i was excercising and doing squats when my right knee started hurting. I put ice on it for an entire day and most of the pain subsided. It has been over 2 weeks but I am still having pain when i get up in the morning and sometimes at night. My k	Most Most likely you may have some ligament sprain, but if the pain continue to bother you then you should get the knee examined by orthopedics to rule out any meniscal injury inside the knee. Sometimes while doing exercise or while playing sports our knee gets twisted and there may be a meniscus tear. Sprain should subside on its own. Other possibility is some ostoearthritis but that depends upon things like age, overweight, morning stiffness. So if the pain doesnt subside please have your primary care refer to orthopedics.Thanks.
1229800	Numbness in right side portion of the body, mainly right leg, arms and face, jaw part also. Had headache and was dizzy.	TIA or Migraine Symptoms that you described as consistent with either TIA or complicated migraine. Need to see a physician and get evaluated.
398985	Anxity and depression what medicine should be used? I have been diagnosed with anxity and panic disorder. The doctor put me on celexa. As i did research its for depression wich i don't have. This medication makes my anxity worse I have constant heart race	There There are two aspects of this question. First, it seems that this medication (celexa) is causing bad side effects for you. There are several reasons for that, one of them is a small variation in liver enzymes (the variation is called a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp) that slows the processing of the medication in the liver and its elimination from the body. This could cause a build up of the drug in the body and bring about intolerable side effects. While there is a laboratory test to determine if the liver enzyme snps are indeed responsible for the side effects, in practice, many physicians simply reduce the dose or switch to another medication that has a different elimination mechanism. The second part of your question is about using antidepressants to treat anxiety and panic disorder. It is known that many antidepressants such as Celexa can be very effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and stopping panic attacks. However, the onset of this beneficial effect is slow and could take several weeks to become noticeable. Fast relief of anxiety can be achieved with benzodiazepine class anti-anxiety medications. However, big drawbacks of these drugs are a loss of the anti-anxiety effect over time and potential development of dependence. Your best course of action would be to discuss your side effects with the physician who prescribed Celexa so that either the dose could be adjusted or it could be replaced with a different medication.

Varies If you can bear weight on it, you may have just "sprained" it and should get better quickly. If either it is painful to put weight on it, or if if does not get better I would be seen. Somewhat concerning for sustaining a tear in the posterior horn if the medial meniscus which is fairly common and sometimes requires arthroscopic surgery.
1010484	Been on antibiotics for a week, on birth control, but very light spotting... No sexual intercourse, period not expected for a week, normal?	YES ! Not well recognized , but antibiotics interfere with estrogen, which controls your mensrual cycle. Therefore, antibiotics can result in spotting or breakthrough bleeding. You need to use alternate birth control methods while taking antibiotics , at least condoms and spermacide.
625369	I have like toothache pain in my left leg especially my foot knee and hip it has a burning sensation in foot and slight swelling around ankle ?

total bilirubin: 1.41 h
ast: 40 h
alt: 100 h
total alk phosphatase: 43 l
serum total protein: 7.1

e.R. Said hepatitis?	Let's try this... I have only a little bit of the story you've shared. Perhaps it's time to see whether the ast and alt get back to normal after two weeks off alcohol and any not-totally-necessary meds you may be taking. If so, this is the start of a healthier life after alcohol. If not, the workup for virus infections, iron overload, wilson's, autoimmunity & need for exercise can begin. Good luck.
1514070	Can hyperthyroidism alone or hyperthyroidism with antibodies or thyroiditis have an affect on lymph nodes of the face and neck? Thank you	Thyroid inflammation can cause some enlargement of neck lymph nodes, but it is generally not something you could detect. Check w/your doctor.

364913	I have been taking Prilosec for about 5 days, now i feel bloating and sharp pains (gas like) in the middle of my stomach, is that a side effect, normal?	Probiotics Reflux is often due to poor digestion which is more often due to insufficient stomach acid than too much. Giving someone like that an acid suppressor removes the symptoms but does nothing to help the underlying problem. Rule out gluten or casein or other food intolerance. Consider betaine hcl in the middle of the meal or digestive enzymes, and probiotics such as kombucha or kefir.
6723253	I have swollen lymph node in my neck ct scan 2 weeks ago said 1.5cm now have pain on that side of neck,shoulder blades,chest and arm past kidney CA?	Your doctor can guid Did you say you have had Kidney Cancer before? Please clarify this part of your history. Ask your doctor to feel this node with his/her hands and tell you if it feels soft(probably benign) or hard which implies possible cancer. If this node gets any bigger, a needle biopsy may be required to make sure that it is not cancerous.
1392467	Still have swelling above left of left knee 2 weeks after arthroscopy. Also pain in left side. Is this normal?	Possible Depending on the severity of your underlying diseases and inflammation, the swelling 2 weeks later may be normal. Discuss with your Ortho dr. and ask all the questions to them as they know your case the best. Good wishes.
593546	I have had swollen  lyphnodes starting  from my neck armpit to chest plate and breast for 5 months now what could it be?	See your doctor Your lymph node enlargement suggest a number of things including virus infection such as "mono", or other virus, a skin condition to which lyph glands may be reacting to, other types of infection such as a cat scratch disease or even tb, or malignant disease of lymph glands. An autoimmune disease such as lupus may do that, or a drug reaction. The best thing would be to see your doctor.
1446923	On metformin for three days, horrible stomach cramps nausea and Diarrhea - not able to eat - can the doc give me something for this?	Common Since this is a common side effect of metformin, your doctor could either titrate your dose more slowly, or change your metformin to the extended release form, or if all else fails, then consider anti-nausea medications to try to help you with these symptoms.
908528	I have pain in the muscle just above both of my knees which is making it hard for me to walk and climb down stairs and slopes?	Growing Pains Without any more information to go on this could very well be what we call growing pains. Teenagers go through periods when their longest bones are growing that can be quite painful. You are on the right track with ibuprofen. You may want to apply heat or have a massage. Your mom or day may also be able to help.
897076	I developed an acute swelling below my right ear today..It is somewhat painful when i chew or swallow (esp something tart).Could this b parotid gland?	Swelling If the swelling is below as in under the ear, it is probably a swollen lymph node. The parotid gland is more in front of the ear towards the cheek.
1603222	Could it be a yeast infection or herpes outbreak with no odor or discharge but itchy clitoris? Could I even have an allergic reaction to something?	Itchy private areas I think you are right on track -this could well be an allergy to something, and I would want to know if you tried any new feminine products, detergents/soaps etc. Certainly fungus likes moist areas and could cause these symptoms. Herpes is usually PAINFUL and would be much less likely. If symptoms don't get better in a day or two, I'd want u to see your gyn or primary doc for a definite diagnosis.
1429465	No period in 3 months.... Had sex after first missed period.. Two negative pregnancy tests taken over a month after sex. 2 yeast infections since????	Ovary Failure You have amenhorrhea, or anovulation. Your ovaries have failed. It is past time to get to the doctor to figure out why and how to get them back to normal.
1035421	I have already had a period, but I am spotting a week before my next period is due. Negative pregnancy test. Can a blood test tell if pregnant now?	yes. Spotting a week before your period is due suggests that you didn't ovulate lately. If you haven't missed a period, spotting is usually not due to pregnancy. If a urine test (first morning urine) is negative, a blood test will generally be negative also.
1097683	For what length of time will 30 mg Vyvanse take to get out of urine?	Vyvanse half life The pro drug is out in five hours. The d amphetamine is out in 50 to 65 hours. Best wishes.

It can take up to two weeks for you to receive all of your results. Give it some time. In the mean time if you're concerned about and std, use condoms when you're having sex and if any of your tests come back positive, it's your responsibility to let all of your sexual contacts know.
615165	I tore my mcl, ACL and meniscus in jan and now im starting therapy to bend my knee will i be able to fully bend it again before surgery?	Maybe Depends primarily on the size, type and location of the meniscal tear. The torn cartilage may block your motion or simply cause too much pain when trying to bend the knee.
6693167	I had a D and C yesterday under general anaesthetic, felt asleep for the rest of the day how I was awake every hour or so throughout the night. Why?	Surgery Sleep disturbances in the first few days after surgery are quite common considering all of the medications given and the stress on the body of having surgery. Since you just had surgery yesterday you may want to see how the next few nights go. If concerned contact your surgeon for follow up.
6792436	I have tiny bumps on the left side of my face (on my cheek) that start clear and as the night time comes turn red form a head start to burn and itch.

I had this complete work-up in 2008 and the impression was no visible coronary heart disease.  Yet said the patient does have diastolic dysfunc	Not everyone needs a Stress test. Generally only people with symptoms need stress tests, except in certain situations such as pre-operatively. Most people benefit from risk factor modification such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation.
597048	I had a stool test , I have 60%of gram+ 40% of gram- bacteria is that normal? Lot of e coli no red/white blood cells salmonella shigella etc	Normal but why? Why did you have this test done? Was it ordered by a bona fide doctor? You may be wasting your money and time on useless tests.
1155489	I've had chest pain and heart palps pretty much for a mnty. Ekg.  Ultra sound -stress test and blood all neg.  Dr suggests beta blockers. Appropriate?	Possibly. A beta blocker might be appropriate if ones heart rate is rapid or if one has premature beats or runs of tachycardia. However, more important is to ask what the underlying problem is causing chest pain and palpitations. A careful evaluation includes blood tests, especially the TSH thyroid test, blood counts for anemia and infection, and a thorough history and physical exam.

Rash The rash may be an allergy to medicine or some other substance if it is more bilateral (both sides) if it is only in a certain area (dermatome, or nerve distribution), and it was preceded by the flu-like symptoms, it may be post herpetic neuralgia (shingles). I would see your doctor.
1250027	10 days of scanty pinkish red discharge, waves of nausea, swollen breasts, slight cramping, fatigue, dizzy, increase appetite, 2 negative pregnant tests?	Trust the test Home pregnancy tests are very accurate. They are the same tests used in a doctor's office. They can detect a pregnancy 7-10 days after conception. The best time to take one is when you miss your period. If you doubt the result you can repeat it in 1-2 days. If you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection.
6704493	Had unprotected sex 4 days before ovulation. Took HPT 4 days after missed period and came back negative. I'm now 6 days late. Yellowish discharge. Could I be pregnant?	Pregnancy tests Home pregnancy tests are very accurate. They are the same tests used in a doctors office. They can detect a pregnancy 7-10 days after conception. The best time to take one is when you miss your period. If you doubt the result you can repeat it in 1-2 days. If you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection.

Skin infection The bump you describe is likely an abscess, a bacterial infection caused once the skin barrier was compromised. It should be evaluated by a physician to determine the appropriate course of treatment. A healthtap prime or concierge consult may also suffice.
1502182	I get itchy red bumps on arms and back of neck when exposed to sun. What can this be? Thnx	PLR Polymorphic light eruption (PMLE) is a skin rash that occurs with exposure to the sun. It is not the same as sunburn. PMLE is not harmful, but can be itchy.The rash normally heals completely within a week if you avoid further sun exposure. Meanwhile, a cream containing corticosteroid will help to settle the rash.
517200	I have pelvic pain even after chlamydia treatment. Could I have had pid? Or is it a side effect of chlamydia?	Yes Yes to both. It can be hard to diagnose pid, but pain afterwards can be caused by pid. In some cases it can progress to become a chronic problem. I think you should be seen to have a more thorough evaluation, and to make sure that the chlamydia infection responded (was cured) by the treatment, b/c if it is still present, then your chance of having chronic pain increases (infertility, too).
517207	Had gall bladder surgery.  Vagus nerve was damaged. Have dumping syndrome.  High acid, nausea, diarrhea, wake every day with nausea. Need diet advice.?	LOW CARBS If you truly have dumping syndrome you should avoid large carbohydrate loads, so minimize your sugars and starches. Vagus n injury is not typically associated with gb surgery. A small percentage of gb surgery patients get urgency after meals. This is temporary, and can be shortened with anti diarrhea meds and avoidance of large meals. Ask your surgeon to clarify. Good luck.
6700396	Are these signs of Pericoronitis?;
mild swelling near wisdom tooth, not too tender, no fever, pain, little redness, but it's reduced in size?	Yup See a dentist if the problem does not resolve on its own.
1135152	Could i put rubbing alcohol on poison ivy/sumac/oak?	Ill advised It is not recommended to use rubbing alcohol on poison ivy/sumac/oak as this does not help clear the rash up and can cause pain/irritation of the affected skin.
1163141	Had sex two days before ovulation, my period is due in one day, having lower stomach cramps and fatigue, cld these be possible signs of pregnancy?	Pregnancy Your sex date, not your symptoms, represents a high probability of pregnancy. If your period does not arrive please do a pregnancy test.
6649418	Can pinched nerve in S1-S2 or L4-L5 cause the lower posterior leg to look rounder than the other leg, but measure the same in circumference?	Yes Because of muscle laxation without measurable atrophy at this time.

You're very unlikely to catch HIV from oral sex, though you can catch other nasty things. If you are horribly worried, you can get a pcr for the HIV viruses. Good luck, and love wisely in the future.
1520280	Does Tuberculosis neck lymphadenitis cause infertility?	TB lymphadenitis No-this disease will not cause u to be infertile. That's at least looking at your 'whole life'. In the short term u may be 'wiped out' from fighting this infection, so sometimes your period won't come (hence you're not fertile for that month). The body does that to devote resources where they need to go -which is getting u better. U will get through this and be healthy enough to have a baby later.
1213514	Could i be experiencing allergies in winter season ? I feel ill no fever ! upset stomach, sinus congestion, sore throat, ear pain/pressure. Low appeti	Yes You may be allergic to indoor allergens which include house dust mites, molds, pet etc. However upset stomach occurs only rarely mostly from profuse post-nasal drips. If your house has a humidifier in the furnace or anywhere, be sure to check for molds in the water compartment. You need to consult your doctor as well since there are many other answers.

Also i went to the doctor and they took a urine test and blood test and they both came out negative. I am also taking these pills that a	After After multiple negative pregnancy tests at home and at your doctor's office, then you probably are not pregnant. There are other reasons besides pregnancy that can cause a woman to miss a period such as: stress, diet, excessive exercise or a hormone imbalance such as with a thyroid disorder or polycystic ovarian syndrome. If you continue to have an irregular cycle, you should give your doctor or your ob/gyne a call. Good luck!
6682434	I am a few weeks pregnant and I have vagina infection.My doctor told me to use Augumenting, Metronidazole & Paracetamol. Is it safe to use this drugs?	Ask him/her You really need to ask your treating OB MD this question as I don't know the type of infection and how many times it has previously been treated in your pregnancy.
1310615	Urine test : protein (1+) , trace of blood, few bacteria, hyaline cast/lpf (0-1), mucus rare. RBC/hpf 3-4, WBC/hpf 4-6, should I be worried?	How do you feel? The urine test contains some abnormal findings but does not show a typical picture of urinary tract infection. How you feel is more important. Try to increase fluid intake. If you experience fever, burning sensation, low back pain, low abdominal pain, urinary frequency and urgency, you may need antibiotic treatment. A urine culture would be helpful.
6731560	Can unprotected sex or oral sex (clit only) cause yeast infection? Usually 1 or 2 days aftr, itching starts. Will azo yeast or biofem gel help prevent	Yes it is possible Oral diflucan or nystatin cream would help.

Stomach problems After an egd, possibly an ulstrasound, and maybe even a cat scan one of the new probiotics maybe tried. They are the new rage in gastric complaints and seem to be helping some people. Best of all, they are all "over the counter".
1272297	I have had a swollen gland on the left side of my neck for two weeks, now it's so sore it hurts to swallow. No fever no other symptoms. Any ideas?	Need for examination Two weeks is long enough to warrant a visit to your doctor so that it can be evaluated properly. It is not feasible to provide and opinion without examining you.
338971	During ovulation period and after intercourse i started to bleed not heavily but only when i wiped.It is been 3 days.Any idea.I am regular 28days?	Various issues Bleeding at times other than your anticipated period can be a hormonal issue that may be addressed with the pill, for ex. Bleeding after intercourse could be related to an abnormal pap test or a polyp, for ex. Both issues should be addressed by your gyn. Usually not serious problems. Good luck n.

Not from these germs There is no single test that can assure you will not have some complication during pregnancy. These results mean these germs will not harm your baby if you have a chance exposure.

Splenic infarct If appropriately managed this will probably not influence your life expectancy. You may have infective endocarditis with emboli to the spleen or there are other areas from which this may occur, most of them amenable to treatment. Relax and follow your doctor's guidance. Good luck
650361	Is it normal to awaken several times in every night (too hot, too cold, bathroom) if i fall asleep within minutes again? Or is that not good rest?	Sleep At age 29 one would expect longer stretches of sound sleep with less interruptions. Practice good sleep hygiene
851925	I have pain in my upper buttocks and my hip joint when moving the leg sideways. Is this a hip problem or sciatica? Groin pain too but could be hernia	Could be either Without a physical examination it is difficult to tell what this could be. It could be either one. In fact groin pain is related to the hip many times. See a physician for examination. Some tests might be necessary and could include hip x-rays to look for arthritis.
1486917	Shoulder blade cracked;nowleft arm goes tingling once in awhile. Can injured left shoulder cause me to feel more discomfort on elbow than my shoulder?	Tingling in arm may be due to nerve or vascular compression (more often the former). The injury that resulted in the shoulder blade fracture may have caused another problem. (nerve root, brachial plexus, peripheral nerve ) Sometimes traction to the ulnar nerve causes parasthesias down to the hand and discomfort around the elbow. A good neurological-exam possibly an EMG-NCS may need to be done to sort this out.
1089940	Vertigo, full feeling in right ear, pain and sensation of fluid draining from same ear but is none. Tinnitus and hearing difficulty as well. Help?

size of the tumor in my left breast. Common practice? Microscopic diagnosis:invasive ductual carcinoma
macroscopic diagnosis: three cores of intermingled glistening gray & yellow	This This treatment strategy is called "neoadjuvant chemotherapy. " it can be used for a woman for woman who have larger tumors (> 3-5 cm) and who wants to have a lumpectomy. Sometimes in this situation the tumor is too big to take out of the breast without the surgery being dysfiguring. Giving chemotherapy first should shrink the tumor and sometimes can allow a lumpectomy to be done instead of a mastectomy so that the woman can keep her breast. The alternative would be to have a mastectomy (the breast removed) and then get the chemotherapy after surgery. In order to be eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy the woman should not have any other reasons why a lumpectomy cannot be performed. The other implication of this is that if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is done and then a lumpectomy is completed the woman will need to have 6 weeks of daily radiation to the breast after the surgery. If a mastectomy is done radiation may or may not be needed.

371124	Is it common to have pain years after knee surgery? I was born "knock-kneed" and as a child had my knees and legs "reset" in an attempt to correct this. Now as an adult, my legs and knees ache tremendously especially with a drop in barometric pressure or	Based Based on your description alone, it is difficult to say. The first thing to consider is that you may have arthritis of your knees, which is the degeneration of the cartilage surfaces of the femur and tibia where they meet in the knee. Arthritis is caused by normal wear and tear on the joint, but can be accelerated by abnormal alignment joint and limb. "knock-kneed" is also called a valgus malalignment, whereas bowlegged would be a varus malalignment. Children will often grow out of many types of leg malalignment on their own. You also mention that your legs were "reset". Perhaps this means that your malalignment was significant and required treatment, and that some of that malalignment has persisted throughout your lifetime. The alignment of your joint and condition of the joint surfaces can easily be determined by simple x-rays of your legs. I recommend you go see an orthopaedist who can examine you and help you better understand why your knees are hurting you.

Do you kno	Recommend Dr eval. I would see your OB-GYN or primary care doctor regarding this. It is definitely abnormal to be having stabbing/burning pain on or around your nipples unless there is an irritant (chemical or physical) that is causing it or there could be a problem underneath the skin layer causing the pain. It is hard to say without a more detailed history and exam however. I would not ignore it.

You can expect him or her to recommend that you stop shaing for a few weeks. And if the problem returns, you may need to not shave at all, or switch to a hair removal cream. Good luck.
6688835	Me and my boyfriend had sexual intercourse i was on the last day of my period, we did use the withdrawal method but it was too late as he came outside my vagina, is there any chance i could be pregnant, i bleed for 4 days.	Small chance On the 4th day of your period its less likely that you would get pregnant (but not impossible). The "withdrawal" method is fraught with peril. If you don't want to get pregnant, you should get on a more effective method. If you use this method long-term, you will eventually get pregnant. Best wishes!
1353667	Is it likely u still have pregnancy symptoms after a miscarriage? or its becos of ma uterus been thick?	Miscarriage Pregnancy symptoms generally follow the BHCG hormone. After a miscarriage this hormone decreases down to zero at different rates in different people. One expects the first menstrual cycle 2-6 weeks after.
6644320	My 19 month old daughter just finished antibiotics for an ear infection and the next morning woke up with yellowish-green mucus from nose and cough?	See her doctor. Yellow mucous does not mean that it's a bacterial infection or that it's an ear infection again. It may be a new virus & since antibiotics don't treat viruses, she could certainly get sick even if she was still on the antibiotic. It is important though for her to be checked to make sure the ear infection went away.

Several causes If each pain is lasting literally 1 or 2 seconds, it is not cardiac. If 30 sec. Or longer, or aggravated by exercise, consider heart.

1424130	Is PG blood test taken too early at 4.5 weeks? conception date july 7th, implantation bleeding started at 4 wk. mark, have had light spotting all wk	Unclear question Conception, as defined by the generation of a fertilized ovum, occurs within day or so of the sex.

Home pregnancy tests should be done 4-5 days after the missed period.
593725	I am 24 and had lower left side abdominal pain for 2 months and pelvic pain sharp shooting vaginal pains. Bleeding between periods  clear ultrasound?	Hard to say Could be a hernia, but that wouldn't cause the irreg bleeding. If the sono showed no cysts, it could be endometriosis or possibly a sexually transmitted infection, if you have had an exposure. Hormonal imbalance could cause the irreg bleeding, but probably not the pains. A bladder condition called interstitial cystitis could cause the pain, but again, probably not the bleeding.

Doc should advise Well, if what you're saying is that your doctor has ruled out some of the more likely causes of your symptoms and they can't find any abnormalities then, you will either simply have to wait to see how this evolves down the road or your doctor should make an appropriate referral to another specialist if he cannot find anything of an organic nature.

121920	I've been getting a burning sensation when urinating, plus a slow weak urine stream?	Weak stream If you are above 50, this may mean big prostate that presses and squeezed the ureter shut. Or if young, it can be a prostate infection and urine infection. Urine infection in men and women cause burning sensation when urinating, but also increased frequency and difficulty to urinate. If accompanied by fever and chills, then it is kidney infection that can lead to blood infection and death.

Can i be pregnant?	Woah, girl, watchout You've got a lot of complicating variable going on here! the antibiotics are going to throw off your ocps to start with, so just those would beg for condom back-up! the missed pill may allow for an egg to get the wrong message and sneak out: again, condoms.

601914	Is there a non surgical procedure to remove large kidney stones from the body?	That depends on... Your definition of large and your definition of surgery.

Cardiac awareness Sounds like your heart has checked out and is okay. Your symptoms are called "cardiac awareness.

392311	What is wrong with me? For over 2 months I have been battling a UTI that has caused the over growth of yeast and bacteria to keep giving me vaginal infections back to back. According to test results I have no current vaginal yeast or bacterial infection,	I'm I'm sorry you've had so much difficulty with this uti. Not all vaginal discharges are abnormal. There's no question that repeated courses of antibiotics will disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in your vagina and contribute to yeast infections. Antibiotics might even set the stage for bacterial vaginosis, which occurs when certain pathogenic bacteria "outgrow" the normal organisms in your genital tract. Once these issues are addressed (that is, the uti, yeast vaginitis, and bacterial vaginosis are cleared up), it may take several cycles for your body to return to its usual state. In the meantime, it would be worthwhile to continue taking a daily probiotic (any multi-strain probiotic will do; it doesn't have to be rephresh pro-b). If your discharge develops an unpleasant odor, or if you develop vaginal itching, burning, or pelvic pain, see your doctor again. For what it's worth, i've attached a link that provides more information about vaginal discharges. I hope you feel better soon! http://women.Webmd.Com/vaginal-discharge-whats-abnormal.

By keeping the record you have an accurate log of events and do not have to try to remember which can sometimes be difficult if there are many.

Anxiety and panic attacks could also be the cause, also eating right before bed. I am glad you are wearing a heart monitor, the more serious reasons will be easier to isolate that way.

1117123	For what reason can't a dentist simply remove the second molar just before the wisdom tooth instead of removing the wisdom tooth that is impacted?	Common Sense It's common sense to remove a tooth that has shorter roots, is difficult to keep clean, and is prone to cavities. Why remove a healthy second molar?

945271	I take 60 mg of Vyvanse along with 30 mg of Lexapro daily. What is the likelihood of developing serotonin syndrome? How deadly is it?	Not likely If you are asking if the combination of vyvanse and Lexapro would be more likely than Lexapro alone to cause serotonin syndrome, i would say 'no': vyvanse's effect doesn't involve serotonin. Statistically, use of large amounts of one med or the combined use of several meds which increase serotonin could lead to S.S. A 30mg dose of Lexapro shouldn't - but combining that w. Other sero. Meds could.

1583236	I had sinusitis after months of surgery(femur fracture), and an IM rod was installed. How cn someone acquired sinus? Had asthma since 9, 17 now.	Anything that causes congestion, can lead to sinusitis. Most times it starts with a viral upper respiratory infection, or sometimes with an allergy. If the fluid sits in the sinuses, it is a good enclosed space for bacteria to grow, leading to a sinus infection(sinusitis). It is not contagious to others.
1212600	Can brain tumors form on side of head above the ear? Would i be able to feel the tumor by pressing it?	Location of tumors Brain tumors can occur anywhere in the brain, but there are more common sites depending upon your age and family history.

1364055	Sudden heat  sensation like blood flowing feel left leg arm and left side of the head when relaxed BP 130/85 pulse 73 can a pinched neck nerve cause this or maybe blood sugar happened twice in 3 days ?	Pinched nerve Not a pinched nerve. The sensation of heat flowing through the left side of the body is not typical of a pinched nerve in the neck and certainly not a pinched nerve in the back. I would go see your medical doctor for an examination and further testing to determine the cause of the left sided flushing episodes.
398300	Should i be conserned about my stitche i had removed? Oozing and bleeding. No warning from dr. So i wasnt expecting it. Is it ok i had a mole removed on my side just above my hip.

6730698	I have been having this pressure feeling between m eyes. My nose is extremely dry and my thoat dty and sore. Also I habe allergies. Is it sinusitis?	Depends Facial pain/pressure is just one sign of acute sinusitis. Other signs include nasal blockage, fevers, congestion/running, loss of taste/smell, discolored nasal discharge, etc. Also depends on how long you have had symptoms for. 10 days would require antibiotic course. See Allergist or Primary Doctor for further workup and treatment. Good luck.
1486605	Would liver problems show on a CBC? I know LFT/CMP is the standard just wondering if high MCH and high MCV could be liver issues or is it another prob	Poor screen High MCV is concerning specifically for heavy alcohol use, but a savvy physician will check for B12, folate, hypothyroidism, and hemolytic anemia (young red cells are big). If the metabolic profile and physical exam don't indicate liver troubles, probably this sturdiest of organs is okay. Remember that a few percent of healthy folks fall a bit outside of reference ranges.

Depo and pregnant If you use depo-provera as a birth control method, it works by making the endometrial lining very thin and less likely to support a pregnancy. However, if you took it for < a month, you could be pregnant. You should see a provider as soon as possible to confirm what is going on.
1158227	I had a pea sized swollen lymph node on my neck about a year ago, now there are ones swollen all over neck and I am itchy. What tests to ask for?	See A surgeon. If you have had so many lymph nodes for this long, and they are not resolving, they need to be biopsied. See a surgeon.

Other has asuperior degree, but mostly performs on upper abdomen and has least post surgical	Research Yourself! Speak with your primary care providers, seek out others who have had positive experiences with their surgeries, if you have family or close personal friends with expertise or experience do factor in their opinions, review data on the surgeons complication or failure rates if you can (data available from many hospitals), interview at least two individuals.

1502054	Otologist (to whom my regular ENT referred me) noticed some of my tonsils were not removed despite having a tonsillectomy 6 mo ago. Is this normal?	RESIDUAL TONSILS Depends on the technique used. generally, tonsilectomy removes the tonsils completes. If the surgeon just debulk them or reduce them, you will see some residual tissue. The residual tonsil tissue may become infected or inflamed in the future and require additional surgery. If you had surgery for obstruction, then I don't expect any further problems with sleep apnea or obstruction. Why Otologist?

Lost 6lbs	See your physician Most intestinal illness due to an infectious agent is self-limited. Viral infections such as the norovirus, which is most common and accounts for 90% of such illness due to virus, usually resolve within 3-4 days of onset of symptoms. If you are not improving other causes must be entertained and this requires a doctor to get a careful history and perform an exam. Until then drink plenty of fluids.

6774828	Tested for syphyllis chlamydia gonorrea didnt wait full 1 hour prior to urine submitting. does this affect accuracy have sharp pain on both sides abs?	Urine test is valid Despite official advice from test manufacturers to wait a while since last urination, it doesn't seem to make any difference. Most STD clinics pay no attention to time since last urination. Your symptoms don't suggest STD, and probably your chlamydia/gonorrhea test will be negative (and reliable). There is no syphilis test on urine; if a blood specimen wasn't collected, you weren't tested for it.
883781	Hi i had a brownish discharge 4 days ago thus guy put his penis by my vagina but not in it and i'm on the Depo-Provera shot what can this mean please help?	There should be No connection between a penis "near" your vagina and your current problems. If they continue, check w/your doctor.

Prolonged cough Some possible causes of prolonged cough can be asthma, post-nasal drip and reflux. Post-nasal drip is commonly caused by allergies and there are a number of different ways to treat it. The first medication does not always work. An ENT can be helpful but is not always necessary to manage it. If you are not seeing a lot of congestion, then it may be helpful to consider asthma or reflux.
1516065	I have hot and itchy ears also neck and body and when I brush my hair I get a sensation I am taking antistamines  which do stop it  ?	External Otitis This is external otitis. You need to get an Rx for antibiotic/cortisone ear drops such as Cortisporin, Don't put heat to the ear. Keep soap out of the ear.

1606174	Have had dull abdominal discomfort on left side near stomach/ribcage for 2 weeks. Found a spot on my ribs under breast: is sore and tender to touch?	Probably not related You may have a rib dysfunction or gastritis, neither of these would be related directly to a skin lesion. The lesion on your skin most commonly would be from a fungal infection and may benefit from an antifungal cream. If your symptoms are not resolving, see your doctor for further evaluation.
182829	Still suffering from ragweed or pollen; what to do with itchy watery eyes?	Allergy drops You could use an over the counter allery eyedrop such as zaditor.

The zaditior drops used to be available only by prescription but are now over the counter.

1237393	21yo female, STD free. Small pimple like sore on lower right vulva. Was prescribed clotrimazole with betamethasone. Its been 2 months and no change?	New Doctor? A pimple like sore is not a fungal infection or something that a steroid cream would be best to treat. Perhaps you need to tell the physician that the treatment plan failed or find a new physician with some expertise in diseases of the skin.

747614	If a lump in the breast is detected via ultrasound, is the only solution to know if it is benign or not is by taking a biopsy?	It depends Sometimes benign features are so characteristic on ultrasound that there is little chance of malignancy, and the lesion can be safely followed with serial imaging. Otherwise, biopsy is probably indicated.
792755	How can you prevent yourself from getting a kidney stone?	Preventing stones In general you can't always prevent stones. The things that have been associated with prevention is a high fluid intake, limit animal products to less than 8 oz daily, limit sodium to 2-4 g daily, limit oxalate containing foods, limit high sugar and fat content, avoid excessive vitamin c, daily exercise, maintain your ideal bmi, high vegetable fiber and calcium greater than 1000 daily.

Also of interest are how large the bites are, and history of allergy (bee stings, etc.).

1214352	My lymph glands in my groin are swollen im kind of scared could this be HIV i had got treated for chlamydia on jan 31st and it still didn't go down !	Stop worrying You're a teenaged male. Every teenaged male has a few swollen nodes in his groin, especially if he's one of these lean guys where they're really easy to feel. Mine used to get big every summer from going barefoot. If you want to be checked for hiv, go ahead, but big nodes are a worry only if they're preposterously big, fixed to structures they shouldn't be, or you're clearly sick.
1394284	Past 2 months pain in left side of head base neck. Now I have random pain and numbness/tingling in arms and legs. What's wrong? Symptoms mimic MS	Explanation Although MS can be a tough diagnosis due to vague symptoms, I would doubt your problems are caused by MS. Suggest you have an MRI of your neck, as that is most likely the anatomic location for your issues. Your head/neck pain could be c/w Occipital Neuralgia, and could consider problems in arms/legs due to peripheral neuropathy if neck films are benign.
1398135	Irregular period but maybe 37 day cycle haven't been feeling good like nausea dizzy headache tummy ache etc. Positive OPK but negative hpt. Pregnant?	Probably not. You have some of the symptoms of a pregnancy but your periods are irregular which decrease of your chance of getting pregnant comparing with a woman who has regular periods. Beside you hpt is negative. I would repeat the hpt a week after missing your period.

Should I be worried?Pregnancy test neg 2 days ago	Irregular bleed It could be that you had a cycle where you didn't ovulate, but this could also be implantation bleeding from a new pregnancy.

It looks like a pimple but I have never had a pimple like this.And never had pimples/acne on my back just wondering if it could be a bite or somthing else.	Without Without examining you, its hard to say for certain what you have, but the red, painful lump you are experiencing could be a boil. Boils usually start out as tender, red areas which become hard and then eventually develop a "head" of white pus. Once this drains, the area usually heals on its own. Most of these are caused by staphylococcus aureas, a common bacteria found on the skin. Occasionally, however, the can be caused by mrsa, the antibiotic resistent kind of staph bacteria. Next time you develop one of these infections, start out by applying warm compresses to the area to help draw the infection out. Then, you should see your doctor so that they can drain it, test for what bacteria is causing it and be able to treat you appropriately - sometimes with antibiotics, sometimes just with drainage. If you ever develop fever, chills, or feel ill with this infection, call your doctor immediately. You can try and prevent these infections by practicing good hygiene and using anti-bacterial soaps. Your doctor may have other suggestions for prevention.
402753	Having a yellow discharge when  wipe and up inside when put tissue up vagina of blood. What is it and what can I take? It itches some and some pain?	Without Without examining you and looking at your discharge under a microscope, it's impossible to tell what you have. You should either see your doctor or go see a ob/gyn doctor. Your symptoms could be any one of a number of things including a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, trichamonas, or some other infection such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. You need a complete gyne exam with cultures and examination of your vaginal fluid. By doing all of this, hopefully your doctor will figure out what is causing your symptoms and be able to treat you appropriately if there is something wrong. Good luck!
331599	I spotted 20 days after the first day of my last period.Period is now 3 days late and had neg hpt but getting cramps and sticky discharge?	One-time symptoms? A doctor can check to see if there is a medical issue, if a woman has mild menstrual-related symptoms. Many women have some variation of mucus discharge, of periods, or a missed period on occasion. Some women feel normal after a few days, but others have bothersome symptoms and follow-up with a doctor.

Any enlargement including pustules, redness, swelling, warm may be a sign of infection otherwise.

Telogen Effluvium In a person with telogen effluvium, some body change or shock pushes more hairs into the telogen phase. Typically in this condition, about 30% of the hairs stop growing and go into the resting phase before falling out.

And i get them all the time i no its not an STD im not active	Need more info I would suggest that you take the oral form (a tablet) instead of a vaginal gel. If that does not do the trick after a week then look for another cause of your infection because Flagyl (the brand name of the antibiotic you are using) is not curing the infection if it is an infection.

Should heal If you have some minor trauma from the masturbation, then you could just let it heal. If you are in a lot of pain, you could see a doctor or try over the counter anusol and ibuprofen by mouth. If you don't think the masturbation caused it, then I think you should see a doctor for evaluation.
406228	Does this sound like cracked tooth syndrome? When i bite or chew hard things, it hurts in the left rear of my mouth and my dentist couldn't find anything on the x-ray. He said there was no cavity, and i can't figure out any other reason it would hurt.


.	This This could indicate a cracked tooth, especially if it had a root canal. Unfortunately this is one of the hardest problems to diagnose. I would recommend an evaluation by an endodontist. A new technology called cbt (cone beam x-ray) is showing some promise in finding cracked teeth. You may just have to let the situation declare itself more before acting with insufficient evidence of what is truly wrong as it may lead to unnecessary treatment.

If your foot feels like it is cold and you have a calf that hurts you want to definitely have it checked out. I would definitely see your doc or if you are having any shortness of breath, chest pain, calf swelling, you need to go to the er to get it checked out but i would call the physician on call if the office is closed and tell them.

I'm not sure whether you mean "narcotics" -- a term which originally referred to any psychoactive compound with sleep-inducing properties? Nowadays this term usually means opiates, such as morphine, heroin, and their derivatives like hydrocodone. Opiates have a solid place in managing physical pain, but other medications work better for anxiety. Not all options are habit forming, either.

Urinary protein excretion is considered abnormal in pregnant women when it exceeds 300 mg/24 hours at anytime during gestation, a level that usually correlates with 1+ on urine dipstick.

Clindamycin better If you are having a bad rxn from the medication do not switch on your own. Contact your doctor and discuss the problem.

You don't need to have an abnormal blood pressure in order to demonstrate you are having heart problems. Many people who suffer heart attacks(for example) appear with normal blood pressure.

Nuclr and IgG so high why?	EBV Like all herpes viruses this remains through your entire life, and there are episodes during which symptomatic recurrences happen, although uncommonly. Interpretation of the serology reports are not easy outside of the clinical presentation of the patient. Ebv infection can also be the precursor (cause?) of numerous malignancies, usually in immune suppressed individuals. See an id doctor.

If your pvcs are less frequent than daily and you only record a 24hr period of time, it's possible to record symptom-free 24hrs, right?

A sinus headache is caused by pressure from congestion in the sinuses. If your blood pressure is fine, a decongestant such as Pseudoephedrine could be taken along with the zpack to relieve the congestion. Ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammati.

Should be seen by MD Achy, painful swelling in forearm most likely from bite, bruise, or infection. Suspect insect bite or sting, cat scratch, or injury. Other rare possibilities.

Probably not serious, but best to be careful.

This can last several days(4 to 6). No matter what food it is. Gas grills or wood burning	You You may be reacting to any one of a number of things. Charcoal grills produce poisonous carbon monoxide gas, so you need to use it in a well ventilated area. When meats are cooked on a grill; the fat that drips below onto the charcoal & can form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). The pah rises with the smoke and becomes absorbed in the meat as well as being inhaled. Heterocyclic amines (hcaâ€™s) can form in meat due to the heat released during grilling. Charcoal contains coal dust and limestone which can also become airborne and can be inhaled. Patients who are treated with activated charcoal can have an allergic reaction with hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. I suggest you keep your distance from grills and grilled meats. Stay well.

Continue to take the antibiotics as prescribed and follow up with your doctor if your symptoms don't resolve. Best of luck.

1329671	Can a STD such as gonorrhea or chlamydia cause a dry orgasm or blockage?	No Is your anejaculation lifelong or recent event? If recently, it is usually caused by drugs, e. g., alpha-blockers, diseases,e.g., diabetes, surgery, e.g., TURP/PVP. Clinically, STD would very unlikely cause complete obstruction in ejaculatory ducts of both sides. So, I gave "no" to your question. Of course, see experts for detailing timely.
1308763	Swollen lymph nodes on left neck, could it be from eczema + acne? Should the swelling go down after 5 days of antibiotics? If not, is biopsy needed?	Painful or painless? Is the lymph node painful or not? There are several reason of lymph node swelling. Infections can be one of the cause, and antibiotics would reduce the size in general if treated appropriately. Acne doesn't usually cause swollen lymph node unless secondary infection exists. Any tooth infection, sinus problem? If no changes in the lymph node size after treatment, you may need biopsy. Good luck!

Usually hsv1 causes cold sores and hsv2 causes genital herpes. However, one can see either type in both sites. It isn't a matter of the virus "turning into" the other.
1291932	I have a rash. One doc said bed bugs. The next said eczema. They are sporadic welts ann patches of red rashes. Any insight? Very itchy. On tummy &back	Eczema Both of the diagnoses are plausible. Bed bug bites also happen often on the arms and legs. Also, you may find them if you search and you might notice a pungent odor.

711035	My low lumbar cracks (or pops) and it also there is a pinching pain that goes through my eight butt cheek from it. Pinched nerve? Sciatic maybe?	Scitica The popping and cracking may not be related unless there is pain in the lower back. A pinched nerve in the lower back can cause discomfort and pain in the gluteal region (buttocks). Irritation of the actual sciatic nerve such as from piriformis syndrome may do this as well. Referred pain unrelated to the sciatic is also possible. Consult your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Profile picture	Allergy It's possible that the serum in the original bite contained material that caused additional allergic reactions in the surrounding skin. Have you applied cortisone type cream to the rash? Taking an antihistamine like benadryl(may cause drowsiness) will also help the reaction and the itch. If redness and burning appear you may be developing cellulitis which requires antibiotic medication and cream.

Need radiation tx As a patient you have the right to refuse any therapy as long as you are aware of the consequencies of your decision. Now, radiation therapy will be needed if you only had a lumpectomy- to reduce your recurrence risk to the same breast. That is for your own benefit. You are young which means your risk for cancer recurrence will be quite significant- so you want to reduce it as much as possible.

For now, you can take ibuprofen and Benadryl for symptomatic relief.
1387783	I blister on vagina. itching and burning. no abnormal smell, no abnormal discharge. I am worried. could it be HPV?	Possible herpes A blister like that is more concerning for herpes than HPV.

Consider ER That sounds like a tough situation, you may need an EKG and blood work to rule out heart attack and maybe even a CT angio to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism although I am hoping that it is something more benign, you may need to see a psychiatrist if symptoms persist despite being evaluated by a doctor that can rule out a cardiovascular process! Stay safe!

58875	I get sometimes large and sometimes small bumps on/around my vagina. I'm not sexually active and they do go away but come back. What is this?	Gyn exam if bumps A good approach for a woman with occasional 'lesions' is to schedule an appointment with gyn or primary care doctor. Often, however, the bumps go away just as a woman is scheduled to see her gyn provider. That can be frustrating for both. However, a good description of the lesions (from looking with a mirror in the light) can be valuable if they are not there when the appointment day arrives.

Are you getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising? - are you taking any medications? Do you drink caffeine and how much? Answering these questions may help your doctor figure out what is causing your headaches, whether it is a serious problem or not, and how to help you. Good luck!

I'm having slight cramps, my breast hurt and kinda look a little bigger, sometimes when i stand up i get really light headed.. I just had a miscarriage october 14, 2011... Everyth	As As doctors, the first thing we do when we hear that a young, fertile woman is having a missed period or abnormal spotting, we check a pregnancy test. You can either take a home pregnancy test as long as it has been 5- 6 weeks since your last normal period, or you can go see your doctor and they can test you. A home pregnancy test is 97% accurate if taken a week or more after the missed period. A blood test can tell if you are pregnant as soon as 7 days after conception and a doctor's urine pregnancy test can tell if you are pregnant around when you next period should come. There are other reasons besides pregnancy that can cause a woman to miss a period such as: stress, diet, excessive exercise or a hormone imbalance such as with a thyroid disorder or poly cystic ovarian syndrome. If you continue to not have your period or if they become consistently irregular, you should contact your doctor.

Your age, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and growth of multiple neck masses raises real concern over the possibility of lymphoma. It is not normal to have these masses in your neck for a year. I would seek the help of an experienced ENT who can obtain a thorough history and exam, and perform fna ( fine needle aspiration) on the dominant neck mass. It should be sent for c & s, cytopathology, and flow-cytometry. Depending on the results, you may require open biopsy ( these are probably enlarging lymph nodes) for further characterization. If the doctor can't do this in the office, you can be sent to interventional radiology for ultrasound-guided fna. You are not wasting anybody's time you must be seen. Wishing you the best.

Unlikely The only confounding factor would be if you conceived too recently for the tests to show up. Pregnancy test are accurate about two weeks after conception.

6786617	The back of my head is tight and it feels heavy and when I get up I get dizzy and it hurts worse. what should I do?	Don't get up... First see a doctor to rule out a serious or life threatening cause of dizziness. At young age it is likely not but would need a complete history & physical.. With an assumption that has been ruled out, this sounds like benign/peripheral vertigo in which case, bed rest x 2 days, increase hydration, and an antihistamine (meclizine), & Tylenol. Also try self Epley and Semont maneuvers for vertigo.

Makes me think fungal- something called tinea capitis. Hair thinning overall or in distinct patches?

Fowler suggested, try using an over-the-counter anti-fungal like lotrimin, Lamisil or tinactin, twice a day. If you don't see any improvement in a few days, see a podiatrist or dermatologist, as it might not be a fungus. If you do see an improvement, keep using the cream twice a day for 30 days, since fungal spores live for 30 days. If you keep getting athlete's foot, you might want to keep using an anti-fungal cream once a day for life. There is also something called a steri-shoe, which is an ultraviolet light that will sterilize the insides of your shoes in 40 minutes. If you keep getting reinfected, you might want to invest in that. I've attached a link.

Also, any good pain management specialist would retrieve any recent radiographic studies and look at them (and compare their findings with the radiology reports); additionally, any/all social and emotional issues need to be taken into consideration during the assessment.

These might include, but not be limited to: 'frozen' joints, somatic pain of varying origin(s), neuropathic pain, and/or a combination of the above. Again, without further information, i would not suggest any treatments, therapies, or medications.

1201887	Is recurrent lymph node swelling a concern. A years time random swellings. The same one under the right ear swells. About the size of two quarters.	Sounds okay Lymph nodes that swell and then regress are just doing their job. One that large is unusual but by no means extraordinary. If they are very hard, attached to the surrounding structures, or if you have obvious signs of illness (fever, weight loss, night sweats), then a biopsy might be in order. Otherwise, the lymph node is your friend and deserves to be left alone.
911558	What gets done first, cavities filled or wisdom teeth pulled?	It depends It depends on the size of the cavity and why the wisdom teeth need to be pulled. I usually make recommendations to my patients and let them decide which needs to be out first.

It is possible that the augmentin has not had enough time to kick in yet. I usually wait 3 days on 1 antibiotic before switching to a new one. However, it is also possible that your child has a secondary viral infection which will not respond to antibiotics and just needs to run its course. If the fever persists over the next day or two, you may want your child's doctor to reevaluate him.

If they do not answer your questions satisfactorily get a second opinion. Good luck.

Go back to your doc and try again.

Headaches The headaches for the past 10 years make a brain tumor unlikely. Albeit a small slow growing mass could manifest this way. The dizziness and the tingling in the arms and legs are nonspecific and require a careful history and physical examination. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine may be indicated. A neurologist can help with headaches and better define the cause of the dizziness and tingling.

The best time to take one is when you miss your period.  if you doubt the result you can repeat it in 1-2 days. If you were pregnant the hormone level would rise enough for detection.

I can believe that you ...don't have arthritis at age 20 and am happy that you don't have it. However, I am certain that you're NOT an enigma therefore, SOMETHING's going on and needs to be nailed down...and it's not JUST growing pains...you've grown! LOL- I believe you may benefit from sharing results of "tests" that've been done with X-rays/CT's etc. uploaded. Send message if you'd like: www.healthtap.com/drsaghafi
106934	Do they still make that sticky tape you put on your nose to help prevent snoring?	Breathe Right "breathe right strips" are placed on the fleshy part of your nose just below the bone and this keeps the soft tissue (cartilage) from collapsing when you breathe. This allows you to breathe better through your nose. Which if you snore because of nasal airway obstruction, well help decrease snoring. But not if the problem is elsewhere. Its worth a shot if you are open to using them every night.

Blister on breast Most skin problems related to being hot on the breast are from a yeast over growth. Many women have chronic yeast overgrowth under their breasts.

The next time you have the spot visit a dermatologist. It would be best to see spot.

May need evaluation Cervical cancer comes usually from hpv related dysplasia and is not related to breast cancer. Breast cancers would not usually present as pimples, though lesions of the deeper ducts can cause bloody drainage from the nipple and should be evaluated by a breast or general surgeon if that is the case. Mastitis and breast abscess are common conditions and can be treated with drainage or antibiotics.

If, however, he is restless, inconsolable, not feeding well, crying and irritable, trying a pediatric dose of tylenol is fine.
1412257	Would TURMERIC Shrink uterine fibroids?i'M Anemic due to fibroids,does turmeric THINS BLOOD? Can i take iron & turmeric at the same time or different.	Turmeric I wouldn't trust turmeric to shrink your fibroids- although the herb is reputed to be anti inflammatory. There are animal studies that show an effect. I think it's better to see a gyn or talk with your primary doc to manage. There shouldn't be any interaction with iron pills. Why not try to get some of that iron through the diet? - dark green veggies, raisins, prunes, dark chocolate etc..take care

Increased Risk No good data on whether hair dye increases cancer risk; best answer: almost certainly not. CT scans are another story. There is increased risk of radiation-caused cancer from CT scans. The risk is very low but not zero. A CT is a highly sophisticated Xray which uses the same type of radiation. Doctors have begun to move away from CT where possible, but sometimes CT is the only imaging study
1110619	Can a severe urinary tract infection cause body aches and swollen lymph nodes under arm pits?	No A urinary tract infection could cause bodyaches, but i doubt it would be responsible for enlarged axillary lymph nodes. More than likely some other condition is going on to account for these lymph nodes. Conditions can co-exist together. Look for something other than UTI to explain the nodes.

 Negp 10 days ago?	Need more info Is pregnancy possible? What are you using for contraception? 10 days ago could have been too early for a pregnancy test to be positive yet.

I would advise you to see your doctor for an exam.
6770912	I'm 17, and a few days ago saw/felt a swollen lymph node in my neck. Today i realized that my armpit and groin had swollen lymph noded as well.	Possibly viral if you have other symptoms such as fever , aches, malaise. Check with a private doctor to have definitive tests, especially if you noted enlarged nodes suddendly without any associated pain, tenderness or apparent illness. The cause need to be known because most causes are treatable. In your age, mononucleosis is prime suspect but you need to be seen.

If your question is whether or not a tumor or bleed is there now after having had scans that did not show them 5 mos ago, then the answer is very likely no. A tumor in someone without a known cancer is unlikely to develop without symptoms in that short time. If you are not having symptoms then its very rare to have a bleed or a tumor that would show up on scans. Talk to md about managing anxiety.
6695110	If I know I treated my chlamydia and haven't had sex/sexual contact with anyone since; could my vaginal itching simply be a yeast infection?	Yesyes yes or something STDs are resistant to one antibiotic get check for STDs and Vaginitis

1541588	Found a small hard lump on joint of middle right finger, palm side (where hand meets finger).  Slightly painful if pushed.  ?	Few possibilities+ How long do you have this.

Consult a hand surgeon/ortho /general surgeon and get opinion if it is not a wart. If itis wart your PCP himself/herself can treat.
644365	Last week my bf ejaculated in me and i took the pill next choice. Im also on birth control .Today im nausea and have a major headache. What can it be?	Why both If you're on effective birth control, why take Next Choice in addition? It's possible, but unlikely, that that's what's causing your symptoms. Could also be anxiety. Don't take two meds for the same thing, it's unnecssary and potentially toxic.
6698196	I am experiencing some form of bladder infection. Symptoms: Pain during urination, brown spotting, abdomen pain, occasional back pain. No acess to doc?	May need antibiotics If your symptoms are indeed caused by a UTI, you should be started on an antibiotic. This will require a prescription and could be managed thru a consult on HealthTap. In the meantime, increase your fluid intake, avoid caffeine and alcohol and use cranberry and/or blueberry juice to decrease bacterial adherence to to lining of the urinary tract. You may find OTC products to help with the pain.
1532407	Discomfort in throat (not really sore,) looks like tonsil stones in deep tonsillar crypt, red throat, swollen tonsils, swollen/painful lymph nodes?	Cryptic Tonsils You have what are called cryptic tonsils. They have folds and holes in them that food particles get stuck in. You can gargle deeply or use a water pick to help get the particles out, but ultimately the treatment is to remove the tonsils. This is done if they are constantly or recurrently inflamed or infected, if one has severe bad breath.

Its on my right side and its really close to the crease where my thigh meets my vagina	This This is a general surgery question not orthopedics. You should consult a general surgeon to discuss the situation. It is not common for a female to have an inguinal hernia. The canal being smaller may put you at a higher risk of incarceration of the hernia. That would be an emergency situation.

The immunology results you describe are most consistent with a remote infection - should not be a problem for a current pregnancy. Talk to your maternal-fetal medicine expert for additional details in your particular case, and avoid all contact with cat litter boxes throughout your pregnancy (and beyond). Also, avoid all undercooked meat!

This could be a lesion near the opening of the vagina, it could be infection as well. Might be a good idea to have the area evaluated a few hours after protected sex, so your gyn can see the area more clearly. And I do mean protected. Most gyn's do not appreciate the smell of semen during an exam.

Most women think any vaginal discharge is a yeast infection. Most are actually not a yeast infection. There are a lot of other things that cause vaginal discharge, including bacterial vaginosis or even a normal fluctuation in hormones. If you try a yeast infection treatment and there is no relief of symptoms in a few days, then see your doctor for an accurate diagnosis.

Breast cyst Sometimes the physical findings are characteristic, but the definitive diagnosis of cyst is made with ultrasound.

HIDA Scan If your HIDA scan showed poor gallbladder emptying, that doesn't necessarily mean you will have abnormal liver function tests. Your gallbladder isn't contracting very well, causing distention and pain. This doesn't effect bile flow from your liver.

The test is mainly used to confirm the presence of T-cell cancers, but is not sufficient for cancer diagnosis because it's too sensitive and not specific. Anything that stimulates the immune system, infections, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory states, will produce a positive.

406124	What causes swelling of the ankles my right ankle swelled up from the inside up to the center of my leg.Excruciating pain and redness. The pain went away after two hours. Two days later my left foot started except only the ankle on the outside swelled wit	In In general, swelling that occurs in both feet/ankles simultaneously is usually the result of the body retaining fluid. It's the feet and ankles that swell only because gravity brings the fluid down there. It's not a symptom of something wrong with the feet or ankles, but rather some systemic condition that is causing fluid to be retained in the body. The 4 most common causes being an issue with either the heart, lungs, liver or kidneys. But when one foot or ankle swells, it almost always means something is wrong with the foot or ankle, and it's not related to fluid retention. Also, fluid retention is not typically painful; certainly not "excruciating." there are many reasons for an ankle to swell and become painful (i'm assuming there was no injury), and when you say first it was one ankle, then it went away, only to start up on the other ankle, i'd wonder about some kind of arthritic process of an inflammatory nature, like gout or rheumatoid arthritis. I suppose there is also the remote possibility you could have had a phlebitis in one leg which cleared up on its own, and then re-developed it on the other lower leg, but this is a stretch, to be honest. My best advice is to have your primary care physician take a look at it. He or she will be able to rule-out certain conditions, order appropriate tests, and make an appropriate referral to a specialist, if needed. But i wouldn't ignore this. I would get it checked out. Feel better.

6654297	I believe I had an ovarian cyst rupture last night after intercourse. The pain was unbearable! Today my ovaries are throbbing. Should I go to the ER?	I IncystYouBeCareful With rupture some blood leaks out. Sometimes more than "some." Sometimes it can be a lot. And blood in that area can irritate the tissues and cause that pain and throbbing. Now, other things can happen down there too, like the ovary twisting, so it's probably a good idea to have it checked out unless the pain starts subsiding considerably over the next 6 to 12 hours, same if you feel dizzy.

Sounds like just a late period.
1004840	Tonsillectomy, how long until you can have red foods?	There is no.. Contraindication to eating red foods after tonsillectomy. This prohibition was started because of a concern that a patient may not be able to tell red jell-o or liquids from blood when it's thrown back up.

If you also have elevated liver enzymes, a workup for autoimmune hepatitis may be continued, but if there's nothing to suggest a liver problem biochemically, I'd not be in a hurry to diagnose despite anti-smooth-muscle.

Injections done by you are inexpensive, e. g. once weekly; just need Rx & about amount. Alternatively, just a high dose orally often works as it is commonly the case that even without intrinsic factor, a large enough daily oral intake, including quality OTC versions, can get around the absorption problem & may be the least expensive route.

Chlamydia Chlamydia can only be cured with a prescription antibiotic, so you do need to see a doctor - and the sooner the better! many people who have chlamydia are also infected with other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, so testing is very important for proper treatment. You may need multiple medications if you have multiple infections.

I ended up getting pregnant in 08 and gave birth to my daughter in 09 she is a healthy 3 year old. I go	Dr Dr moffitt gave a good answer. If you have regular 36 day cycles every month, your most fertile period is from days 18 to day 26 (day 1 = the first day of your period). Start the ovulation predictor test every day from day 18, and check between 10 am and noon, not the first time you wake up, which may be too early in the day for an accurate test. 2 other points - one ectopic pregnancy increases the chance of another one to 10-30%, but your fertility depends a lot on how good your remaining tube is, which should have been checked at the time of your surgery in 2006. You have had two pregnancies including your daughter since then, which is more reassuring, but get checked out with a blood pregnancy every time you are late by 3-4 days or more for your period, 'just to be safe'. One miscarriage is not too worrying either as you already have a kid, but if you have another miscarriage you should get checked out by a specialist (reproductive endocrinology and infertility md or rei) for causes of miscarriage. Some of these could have developed since your daughter was born. Best wishes for another healthy pregnancy.

Have abdominal exam It's time to see your doctor if this has not been relieved in 2 weeks. A complete abdominal exam will help solve the dilemma, as well as a food jounal to rule out something that you've eat, or could possibly be allergic to that's causing the bloating, or something else altogether. Drinking alcohol can factor into this too. So, get this checked out soon, and you'll start feeling better.

In the meantime, rest, stay well hydrated, and monitor your temperature.
748425	My body has been itching for about two months now but i don't have rashes! i get little tiny red bumps but they come and go. What can this be?	Itching with no rash The list of conditions that could cause itch without rash is long, like thyroid problems, liver or kidney disease, even malignancies among others. Need a complete workup including a chest xray, urinalysis and stool exam for ova and parasites x 3. Also small red bumps that come and go could be a type of urticaria (hives) that is very itchy. Please see your doctor right away for proper diagnosis.

I have been on anti biotics for 41 hours. Now the pus is draining ove	You You have been put on antibiotics to contain the infection and to prevent its spread. The draining that you are experiencing is the infection leaving your body via the path of least resistance and this is probably the desired result. If you feel as though you are experiencing any ill effects such as heat, swelling or general malaise, or if you just want to make certain that all is ok, call your dentist and have him take a look. But by no means should you stop the antibiotic.
241588	Have been experiencing severe numbness in my hands (mainly left hand from middle finger to thumb) and, recently noticed my big toe on the left foot doing the same. The only other symptom is spells of blurry vision. What could be the reason for this?	Nerve dysfunction Extremity (hand and foot) nerve complaints are usually one-sided when discussing entrapment neuropathic symptoms. Blurry vision is consistent with upper central nervous system issues (optic nerve). You should see a neurologist for a primary evaluation to differentiate the two symptoms to make sure that they are not related, which they are not.

See an endocrinologist for a complete history ; physical exam as well as hormonal work up. "endometriosis"; "irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)"; "psychsomatic disorders" ; "panic attacks" need to be ruled out also.
849046	Is it possible to have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) -without- constipation or diarrhea? Can I have IBS without having constipation or diarrhea?	Unusual Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder affecting your large intestine. It commonly causes cramping, abdominal pain, bloating gas, diarrhea and constipation, and can be controlled.

However, if this does not recede (as a bruise normally does) than medical evaluation may be considered. Take care.
1216947	How long does it take to heal from a diagnostic laparoscopic surgery done on my uterus to remove fluid and possibly both ovaries?	Ask your doctor! How long does healing take place after a surgery? That depends on how the surgery is done with or without complication and how the patient expectation is. Generally speaking, most of patient would feel well within 1-2 weeks. Go to ask and work with your doctors. Universally, practicing healthy lifestyle with no overindulgence and obsession will surely benefit living a long happy life. Best...

Chlorine burn Appears that you have sustained a chlorine irritation / burn to your naso-pharynx-tracheal-bronchial tissues. If external, the immediate remedyvis long ice cold water rinsing. You cannot do much of that, but prolonged mouthwashing, gargling, and nasal washing can help. Then, you need an inhaler. Saline breathing treatments may help but best is a metered dose steroid inhaler. So see a prescriber
1568599	Can untreated bacterial orchitis (treated now) cause somewhat desensitization of the testicle when being touched?Because of scarring?

1324982	What to do about rubella IgM may b positive in early pregnancy?	Rubella IgM IgM means recent infection and chances of transmission vertically to fetus are rather high. Universal vaccination was started because it is very difficult to treat a baby born with rubella infection and I am unaware of an effective treatment for fetus. In such a case, would recommend working closely with infectious disease doctor and perinatologist to monitor the fetus to explore the options.
1523990	I am on 5th month treatment for TB neck lymphadenitis. Can TB neck lymphadenitis cause infertility? Can i conceive in future after treatment?..	No TB neck lymphadenitis won't cause infertility but if your tubes are also involved it can cause problems. You should be able to conceive and have healthy babies after finishing treatment. If you have any problems, you doctor should know about the TB. It is a simple test at that point to check for tubal damage. I had TB myself at 16 and have had no problems since. Hope you do as well!

1464992	Can leg/foot numbness be caused by a cervical issue?  I have C7 right nerve root compressed, but the last 2 days have had  tingling in right leg/foot.	No Not likely to be related. However, if the symptoms persist, the Dr. treating your neck can probably address your new problem.
1577508	Cant get rid of the fear of pregnancy.Virgin&avoid sex but scared that objects i touch may have sperm&i may transfer to my vagina.Cant even shower?	Fears like this Should be addressed with a therapist. Realistically, you can't get pregnant not even a sexually transmitted disease in the ways you're worrying about. I can't talk you out of this on the web and I'm sure others have offered all kinds of rational (to them)explanations which haven't helped. This is probably a symptom of a more serious psychiatric condition. See a therapist or psychiatrist.

1263242	Symptoms of uti, given amoxycillin & later found white discharge & itchyness after urination which is now gone, should I take the antibiotics anyway?	No The Amoxicillin treated your urinary tract infection which is probably why you don't have any burning anymore however antibiotics can also cause fungal infection which may explain the white discharge that you have if all your symptoms all now resolved you don't need to take any more medications if you still have symptoms please see your physician for repeat anabiotic course or antifungal medications for the fungal infection.

If you have any concern about the progress of your healing call your dentist for an emergency look-see.
128561	What blood tests will detect coronary heart disease/ heart artery build up? Any tests? Would the d dimer test show?	Many tests. An early test would be a stress test with an electrocardiogram or ecg. This is done until there are symptoms and/or st segment changes on ecg, and/or target heart rate is achieved. Thallium 201 imaging makes it more sensitive and specific. The definiitive test is coronary arteriography to see the arteries. A d-dimer test checks for fibrin degradation products for deep vein/lung (pe)thrombosis.
128562	What blood tests will detect coronary heart disease/ heart artery build up? Any tests? Would the d dimer test show?	None There are no blood tests that specifically show cad. There are many tests, however, that act as markers for CAD - e.g. Cholesterol, crp. The d dimer is not used for CAD at all. It is a marker for inflammation, including possible thromboembolism.

592055	I have numbness and slight swelling on my left side starting at my shoulder socket following under my collar bone there is no pain when moved?

Please see your doctor for a physical exam. She may order images of the shoulder, arm, or breast area depending on the likely diagnoses.
314168	Gi issues that stay for weeks, go, & return: bloating, gas after food, nausea after drinking h2o , slow weight gain, alternating constipation/ thin poo?	Nonspecific symptoms Your symptoms are nonspecific & may be due to gi-related inflammation, infection, motility disorders, or even extra-intestinal pathology. However, irritable bowel syndrome should be strongly considered & appropriately evaluated given your age, duration of distress, alternating stool pattern, & associated functional-sounding complaints.

Doctor for allergies Allergists treat the allergies and the ear- blocking and headaches that come with them. They don't do neck adjustments in the USA.

If the leg symptoms were present before the laminectomy, I would not expect them to go away. They are caused by nerve irritation.

If the symptoms are not related to the laminectomy, then I would have to give a different answer.

373365	How long after surgery to start physical therapy? My brother says they’re going to start me on physical therapy while i’m still in the hospital. Isn’t that too soon? Shouldn’t i heal from the surgery first?	Though Though it may seem opposite to the idea that one needs to "heal" a bit before rehabilitation, in many instances physical therapy is appropriately started while in hospital. Hello: the therapists are familiar with your surgery and will follow guidelines by your surgeon. If there are needs for a safe transition to home (e.g. Some may need home setting modifications if stairs are difficult), starting therapy while in hospital also allows the therapist to assess your mobility and safety and help your social worker arrange specific things you need before sending you home. For example, patients with hip or knee replacements are routinely out of bed the next day and taking a few steps, and in case of hip replacement patients they are working on precautions to improve the safety of their hips. Hope this helps! sincerely, jim hsu, md seattle, wa.

It can take 4 to 8 weeks from your initial infection until you have symptoms. You can spread mono not only when you are infected, but up to several weeks (sometimes months) after you no longer have symptoms. Now, if you are physically feeling up to it, then returning to school is ok. But, you don't want to be doing vigrous sports (especially contact sports) for possibly three months due to concerns about rupturing your spleen (if it was enlarged).

I suffer from chronic glomerulonephritis which causes my knees, feet and face to swell occasionally. Would a lower face lift provoke a swelling episode	Even Even without chronic glomerulonephritis you should expect pretty significant facial swelling after a facelift. With that diagnosis, though, it is very important for you to get medical clearance from your nephrologist to have surgery. He or she would best be able to say whether your kidney disorder creates additional risks to facelift surgery.

Blood HCG If you are feeling like you're pregnant, and with an unexplained stop in your periods, I don't think it would be a bad idea to have a blood pregnancy test just to make absolutely sure that's not what's going on. On the other hand, some women are very sensitive to the hormones in the OCPs and this can cause you to have much lighter periods, if any at all. Talk to you doc.

657980	My husband got shot in his upper thigh. Femur got replaced with metal rod. Why is his leg shorter than the other? Will this affected his back?	Yes The doctors who placed rod were perhaps not as skillful as they might have been, although placement of a metal rod to replace a shattered femur, to save a leg, and preserve function is no mean feat. In the old days it would have been simply off with the leg. A unilateral short leg can impose mechanical stress on sacroiliac joints of the pelvis and, over time with repetative stress, loosen them.
747346	Headache, 102.3° f fever, nausea, vomiting, extreme neck stiffness, cold hands, feet, and lips. Doc said its a virus. Just gettin worse. Meningitis?	Could be Virus can cause meningitis.
6648556	I have a birth mark on the back of my head, but my hair covers it. If I were to get it removed, will I have a bald spot?	Yes, a small one... about the width of the scar. When a lesion is removed, the surgery approximates the skin margins together so that it heals promptly, but the scar itself will not have hair follicles. Usually hair around it grows and covers the scar, so it is not noticeable unless one's head is shaved. If there is a concern about the birth mark and skin cancer, your life is most important.
883474	Had rectal bleeding for a few weeks 2.5 years ago. No bleeding since. Dr said it was likely fissure that healed. Would colon cancer continue to bleed?	Rectal bleeding If your rectal bleeding has come back, then okay to get in to your doc for evaluation. More likely this is a hemorrhoid or recurrent fissure. Cancer in your age group is very low incidence. However, an exam under anesthesia will lead to a diagnosis, and treatment. Good luck.
6642892	Recent blood work.  Wbc, Rbc, hgb, hct, mcv normal.  Low mchc.  High Rbw.  What does this point to?  Had iron def anemia in past.	You can look these all up, e.g. http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell_distribution_width, etc. If the MCV is ?er Nl, combined with ?ed MCHC these could be c/w some mild Fe deficiency currently. If Reticulocyte count is elevated, this would be c/w the?ed RDW due to an ?ed mix of younger, immature plus older cells. These values just clues.
1447845	I had an ovarian cyst laparotomy in june. 2014. Since then I still have recurrent pregnancy symptoms with regular feeling of a twist in my lower abdom?	Hard to know... "Pregnancy symptoms" = lots of things = nausea, breast tenderness, abdominal fullness, swelling of breasts or genitalia, etc. It's hard to answer without knowing this. Would you please ask again, and be more specific, or consult me directly? Regarding a "twist" sensation, this is likely muscle spasms. Your muscles were sewn shut and they often spasm when they pull on stitches with activity.
760391	Is it okay to drink water while vomiting and diarrhea?	Yes Try to drink as much as you can to avoid dehydration. 1 liter of fluid = 1 kilogram of body weight = 2.2 lbs. If your weight decreases by 2 lbs, your a 1 liter "dry".
940803	Had a small red patch of skin on penis, little itch, some peeling. Went away after a couple of days. Just dry skin or should I be concerned?	An exam Carries no harm and conversation with infectious disease doctor/dermatologist/urologist/your primary care doctor (take your pick). You will also want to inform your mate.
1391066	I'm experiencing insomnia, headaches, cold when others aren't, dizziness, spaciness mentally, and I have darkness under my eyes. What could this be?	Thyroid or Anxiety It could very well be a disease of your thyroid. It could very well be a form of depression and anxiety. I would advise you that given how extensive the list of your problems is that you get to your family doctor urgently to figure all of this out.
6730705	I have had right shoulderblade pain for almost a week. Now my forearm and elbow feel sore. If I lay down the pain is tolerable. Pinched nerve?	Probably The term cervical radiculopathy refers to symptoms that stem from a " pinched nerve" in the neck. Your pain follows the C7 nerve pattern and so it very well could be the source of your symptoms. An MRI would be the test of choice to confirm the disgnosis.
1448833	43,coughing>5wks in morning/night,after antibiotic phlegm change from green 2 clear but still thick&feel chest congested&tightnessOf breath.cough wors?	Reactive airways? Reactive airways, or asthma, can be triggered by lung infections and requires inhalers for treatment, which would explain why only your symptoms of bronchitis or pneumonia improved. Residual pneumonia , pleuritis or heart problems can also be the cause. Recheck needed :)
1445803	Calf cramp since yesterday.  Knots and tight feeling in calf, behind knee and thigh. Could this be a dvt? Had negative d dimer 2 weeks ago.	D Dimer= not specifi ...4 DVT gold standard is duplex doppler/ ultra sound. If leg swollen, even down 2 the foot is common, if on BCP Ur chances R higher. Talk 2 Ur provider about having this done.
6632085	For the last 3 days i have woke up with severe stomach pain , nausea, diarrhea, gas, and a really bad taste in my mouth when i burp what can i do ?	Go to doctor You should visit your doctor because from the symptoms you described there may be a systemic problem. A person who has gastrointestinal problems can exhibit a fowl taste in the mouth
6623413	Hard swollen gland where jaw meets ear. Likely parotid. Had for years, but now seems to be causing TMJ symp Who best Dr or dentist to help?	Oral surgeon or a TMJ specialist are best to diagnose and treat TMJ related symptoms,and should be able to see if there are any things associated with the parotid gland or affected by it and suggest treatment plan .
272537	I fell down and having pain in my left leg inner side of knee. No bone crack as per xray. Two and half month passed but pain has not gone. Pls guide?	Many possibilities There are many possibilities. X-ray may have been normal, but there are also possibilities of tendonitis, bruising, or even sprains. You should try taking a NSAID for 7-10 days. If symptoms continue for 2 weeks, you should talk with your doctor.
1190829	I've had watery lungs chronic cough fatigue + mucus in sputum-1/1/14.  I've taken augmentin and prednisone. Recurring cold sxs. I've seen 2 drs. Help!	More treatment Do you have wheezing? Have you had a chest xray? You may have asthmatic bronchitis which is often a prolonged, stubborn problem following a viral infection. I would consult a pulmonologist for further evaluation and treatment which may involve a longer course of prednisone(and medication to protect your stomach). Obviously you shouldn't smoke.
1384168	Period was 5 days late (always on time) has now come, no usual symptoms like cramps bloating dizziness nausea . Could I be pregnant ?	May be anovulation. since you had a period you sould not be pregnant. If it would ease your mind do a pregnancy test.
916268	Had a tilt table test that came back normal. Still get these faintish feelings but don't actually faint. Is it poor circulation possibly?	Unlikely The only way you can pass out due to lack of circulation to the brain is to have severe blockages in both carotid/vertebral arteries - which is very unlikely at your age. However a carotid/vertebral doppler/ultrasound can rule that out. Your medications may also contribute to the symptoms.
6636972	Throats gets sore to where it really hurts to swallow and then it'll stop and then come back again throughout the day. My nose and ears are very congested. I have no energy I'm super tired but I have no fever. What's wrong with me?	Mono Not A NoNo While congestion is uncommon, think about Mono (mononucleosis). The rest of what you said sounds like it. Or maybe just a common respiratory virus. A blood test will tell if you have mono, so get to a doctor, because if it is mono you'll need some perspective on this illness as well as some specific instructions. Don't push yourself. Be sure you have a healthy diet and get enough rest.
1553279	What is the name of the Endometriosis Surgery (Laparoscopy didnt work) that removes endometrial cells embedded in uterus ligaments  (Adenomyosis?)	Surgery Is it endometrial ablation?
6676438	My period is now 8 days late, I have taken a home pregnancy test and it was negative. I than took one at the doctors and that was also negative. my breast were really sore about two weeks ago, and they still hurt but not as much. Could I be pregnant?	Tests are accurate If you have taken pregnancy tests at home and they are negative then you can rest assured that you are not pregnant. You will need to see your doctor to discuss irregular periods. If the symptoms you are experiencing were caused by pregnancy than that implies that your hormone level would be high enough for detection
6681566	Had inch sized swollen groin lymph node for a month after unprotected sex. It eventually went away but I never recognized any other symptoms. Herpes?	Lymph node not usually without a rash do you have herpes. Probably just a lymph node that was swollen only.
1547918	I had medial epicondylar release/ulnar nerve decompression 6mnths ago. I'm now starting to drop things & sometimes it makes a snapping sound. In pain?	Contact surgeon in my opinion, the person you would want to contact would be the surgeon who did the first procedure. Unless of course, you have learned how to do medial epicondyle release procedures in the last six months in which case you may be able to buy a few surgical utensils and do your own repair.
700965	Dizziness/weakness, vomiting, diarrhea. Started this evening. Stomach flu?	Gastroenteritis It may not be the "flu" per se, but it sounds like you have a GI bug. Usually this is from a virus. For most people, the biggest risk is dehydration. Drink an electrolyte solution or make one yourself. Google "oral rehydration solution recipe". Otc meds like loperamide, used according to label instructions might be helpful.
6738695	Hello, my mum lost her sense of smell due to chemo/radiation for triple neg breast cancer, will it ever come back? its been almost a year since she has finished chemo and 9 months since she finished radiation therapy. she is 54 years old. Thank you	Possible. Possible, perhaps not.
1402857	Is having sex in a bubble bath dangerous in terms of getting a UTI or yeast infection?	Unlikely Soap and water may reduce chance.
1244709	I'm have these small red bumps towards my vagina and it itches from time to time and i didn't shave. What can this be?	Pimple Such changes can occur in many different parts of the body. Of course, there are many other possibilities (e.g. Inflammed lymph nodes). Bartholin's gland cysts (although not in the classic location) is yet another possibility. Sitz baths (soaking the perineum in a shallow pan/bucket of warm water with a touch of epsom salt for about five minutes daily) can sometimes decrease any symptoms.
819537	How would lung cancer or breast cancer cause upper back pain? I have had CT chest ok/ MRI throactic no contrast ok. Missed cancer?	Several Direct invasion metastatic spread are the most common. There are a lot of non cancer causes of chest pain.
1205391	What to do if I have this rash on my feet, legs, elbows, fingers, armsdespite the medicines i've been on, and now, these itchy blister like things show up?	Many possibilities There are many types and causes of skin rashes that could cause itching. Several types of inflammatory conditions of the skin, allergic reactions, and sometimes bacterial, viral or fungal infections can cause rashes on the skin. Insect bites can also be the cause of a rash on the skin. Have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment.

Insect bites can also be the cause of a rash on the skin. Have it evaluated by a professional and get the appropriate treatment.
6691089	Diagnosed with an ear infection: prescribed amoxicillin, took it. Didn't work after a week. Prescribed a z pack, took it. A week later it still hurts?	Otitis media Infections can be caused by viruses and bacteria. Given your poor response to the antibiotics several things could have occurred. You may well have killed the bacteria causing the inner ear event...but the inflammation from the infection takes longer to resolve. Its also very possible that this was a viral infection..therefore no antibiotics will work.
276547	"my girlfriend an I are sexually active, about a week and a half ago, she's been getting stomach aches and head aches. She has a retro uterus, could she be pregnant?

351467	Hi for the last few weeks I have had a constant ache just under my shoulder blade at the top of my ribs on the left side i factured them two years ago?	Unlikely that they Are the source of your pain. This could be myofascial or muscular in nature or even related to a local nerve issue due to entrapment within the shoulder or even from the shoulder itself. A neck problem such as a disc issue can present this way too. If it persists or worsens in spite of time., local treatment like heat or massage or use of otc meds if not contraindicated , see your doctor.
949942	I have rash on my chest. Not itchy. Not red. Just small bumbs. What does it mean?	PImples? Do they look like pimples? Do note that Amoxicillin often causes a skin rash if you have taken it within the past week or two.
563512	I had a laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis. Doctors suggest goin on the pill to avoid it recurring, i feel its unhealthy, what should I do now?	Listen to doctor It is widely known that the pill will slow down the progress and recurrence of endometriosis. The pill is not "unhealthy" - discuss your concerns with your doctor.

azithromycin ?	Infection Yes, it sounds as if you have an infection, but whether the necessary treatment includes antibiotics will depend upon the cause of the infection and if bacterial, whether they are sensitive to what you were treated with.
6698707	My fifth toe is swollen & red & i cant bend it down or walk on it cause of an injury but x ray doesn't show fracture so what's the problem ?	Toe pain Toe pain can be the result of overuse with tendinitis, stress fracture, bunions or metabolic issues. It could also be an infection. Please further inquire with the physician where you had xrays completed on what to do next.
15240	How can I tell if an existing mole is melanoma?	See your doctor Only your doctor can definitively diagnose a melanoma. This will usually involve a biopsy. But you may be suspicious about a mole if it changes over time in terms of shape, edges, color, or size. Any suspicious, new, or changing moles should be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible.
6785599	So at 17 i went to the dermatologist and she said i should get these moles removedsoidid and she saidit will be a small scar and there big scarsabt 20?	Please clarify. Not sure what the question is. Please clarify and re-ask. Thanks.

681012	What to do if i heard that drinking too much cocacola causes kidney stones?	Folklore Your body generates a huge amount of phosphoric acid just from burning food. I've read a few of these articles & the authors overlooked this. Any retrospective study is fraught with pitfalls (people with an illness tend to remember things that they are told may have caused it -- the basis for a huge number of "health news" items). Enjoy us soft drink -- water quenches thirst cheaper & < calories.
393725	What could be causing my severe abdominal pain 1. Am 34 year  old man with severe pain for 2 months (10 on scale of 1 to 10)
sent home several times by management
2. Tests have ruled out appendicitis, kidney stones, including stuck kidney stones, hernia
3	Unfortunately Unfortunately the description of your symptoms does not allow me to provide a very educated suggestion as to the cause of your problems. In particular, the causes for abdominal pain can be quite diverse, ranging from an "internal organ" problem, such as gallbladder, intestine, pancreas, urological, to musculoskeletal, such as a hernia, to neurological, such as a pinched nerve or neuralgia due to infection. You have indicated that kidney stones, appendicitis and hernias have been ruled out, but other causes could include: enteritis, colitis, pancreatitis, gastritis, motility problems with the intestine, diverticulitis in order to provide a more logical path to working out the cause of your pain, one would want to know about the nature of your pain (characterize it, sharp, dull, constant, crampy, associated with eating, change with movement, referred pain), and associated symptoms, such as the presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, distention, weight loss, other medical history, including reason for gallbladder removal, evidence of alcohol abuse i would imagine that you have gone thru a host of tests, probably including mri, ct scans, and possibly endoscopy and/or colonoscopy. I see that you have had a h. Pylori breath test for evidence of gastritis (not sure if you are having heartburn and indigestion). You did not provide liver function tests, tests for pancreatitis, urine tests. In the end, you primary care physician should feel free to liberally utilize specialists to assist.
1075936	Can interstitial cystitis cause pain that starts at your belly button and runs straight down into your bladder?	Yes ...
1015685	Can you get a girl pregnant if you have low sexual binding globulin?	Yes! If a man can ejaculate, he most certainly can get a girl pregnant unless tested and told that he has no sperm or immotile sperm. Sexual hormone binding globulin is not going to be what determines fertility for you. How did you find out about your shbg levels?
1407801	Patch of eczemic looking skin on bum, few small red bumps clustered around/on area. Also itches sometimes. Do I need to see MD?	Skin Patch You may have a fungal infection of the skin. See your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment.
1199226	Clear sticky spontaneous nipple discharge right breast. Small lump on left normal in 2012. All labs normal incl. Prolactin. Cbe normal now what?	Nipple discharge "galactorrhea" is the production of breast milk. Sometimes women can have nipple discharge that is not milk. A doctor can tell the difference by looking at the fluid under a microscope. Fibrocystic breast disease can cause nipple discharge. But i'd probably see a breast specialist and get a breast ultrasound to rule out some other reason. There's even a test called a "ductogram" that can be done.
6711936	Have I.H. and deviated septum on l. side. Weird smell, used netti pot, fluid come out left side but not right. Bad pressur in ears/eyes/l.side of head?	Septal deviation See ENT to examine and offer a surgical option.
1510675	My last period started August 30th 2014.I had spotting on September 22nd and little  23rd.I have tender breasts and little cramps.Could I be pregnant?	Possibly if your periods are regular and this one was light and you have has sex you may want to do a pregnancy test.
748504	I have a swollen lymph node on my under arm, maybe the size of a small grape. I have bad allergies and started my cycle, will that cause the swelling?	Monitoring Centers Lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food. Lymph nodes "taste" the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers, etc. When it detects a problem, it alerts the immune system and your body reacts. They enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react. They shrink when all is well.
602251	Are dense breasts a problem? My doctor sends me to do mammograms every year. But I am afraid of too much radiation! is this a problem?	It is ok. See womenshealth. Govand radiologyinfo.Org under mammogram.
253915	Should I be seeking a second opinion when the radiologist stated an area on my baseline breast scan to be within normal tissue after a repeat mammogram and ultrasound? He would like to see me again in 6 months to compare scans.	Any symptoms? It is common for a 6 month repeat to be performed. This is especially true when you do not have any prior films for the radiologist to compare to. If you are having symptoms (mass you can feel, pain, bloody nipple discharge, skin change), then seek a breast surgeon for evaluation. He/she will review your films as well. If no symptoms, then make sure you return in 6months for repeat films.
6701125	I have abdominal pain all the time, diarrhea (5-10 bowel movements a day), foul smelling stools, and lots of undigested food in my poo.what could ihav?	Lots of things... ...like infection, inflammation, malabsorption, maldigestion, dysmotility, more. If you are in constant distress (as you describe), its time to find out why and what treatment options exist. Good luck--
1555605	I was diagnosis wit mild left sided UC,since then in remission,8 months no meds.Only used 5-asa. With mild colitis what r my odds of surgery in the future?	IBD IBD or inflammatory bowel disease can be tricky to deal with - it sounds like you are having a recurrence of colitis after being treated with 5-asa agents? If this is the case- be sure and see your doctor, you may simply need another course of 5-asa agents or a stronger medication. Most patients respond favorably to medicine and do not need surgical intervention. Be sure to see your doc :)
689578	My period is 3 weeks late, i gained weight. Have nipple sore. But when i took blood hCG test. It is <0.1. Does that confirm that i m not pregnant	Yes That level is consistent with the nonpregnant state.
1329786	I have a yeast infection my period is three days late I keep having vivid dreams and a negative pregnancy test could this be a sign of pregnancy?	Pregnant? Wait 7-10 days and recheck your first AM voided urine using a home pregnancy kit. They are inexpensive and accurate. If a problem persists, see your doctor. Best wishes
1418147	Help docs, is having an MRI test done on my knee bad while I'm pregnant?	Necessary? It can be safely done WITHOUT contrast after 1st trimester. But , it makes more sense to wait until after baby is born. Unless you need emergent surgery, there is no reason to get the test earlier. Having elective surgery while pregnant is far riskier than an MRI
1569813	I have partial fallopian tubes, but they are still connected to my overaies but a piece was removed by uterus, Is natural pregnancy possible?	No Your Fallopian tubes would have to be re-implanted into the uterus or IVF is your only option.
1478264	Brown old blood and cramps a few days after regular period time. No period yet. Missed bc a day or two; sexually active. Could be stress?	Premenstrual symptom Your period is delayed but appears to be on the way. Could be due to stress. If you do not get your period in few days take a pregnancy test .
1475979	Is it safe to give my 3 1/2 yr old grandson Gatorade? He has been vomiting and diarrhea for almost 24 hours. He will not drink Pedialite.	Yes but Generally speaking yes if he can drink it pedialyte is better because it made for children and it comes on many forms including ice
1307425	Can i rule out pregnancy with beta hCG &lt;1 and nothing on abdominal ultrasound 9 weeks after last sexual contact? Beta hCG tested from 3 different labs	Asked and Answered Your question has been accurately and repeatedly answered.
6625229	Strep test was neg.. doctor thought my vocal cords were swollen due to coughing. If thats the case why would my ear,throat, neck & shoulders be aching?	Sore Although your strep test was negative, there are lots of viral processes that can still cause symptoms of ear, throat and neck pain. Make sure you check on your strep culture. Fluids, rest ibuprofen and I think extra vitamin C good. You are in your 20's. If you continue to feel tired and run down check mono in a week or so.
1603906	Pain bottom of foot. Discomfort and tenderness in spots from back of knee down calf. Leg feels heavy and foot dragging a bit. Dvt? Musclar? Nerve?	Evaluation you should not wait. Go see a physician to be evaluated. If a DVT you could have significant issues if not treated immediately.
1518318	Swollen cheek jaw Pain, ear sensitve started overnite,treated antibiotics thinking lymph nodes swelling,but no use.seen dentist,xrays teeth fine ,help?	2nd opinion Without being able to see those radiographs or the swelling or your teeth, it is hard to give you a second opinion. I suggest you see a specialist in your area (an endodontist or an oral surgeon) who can re-evaluate your mouth and determine what ails you.
687082	Swollen lymph nodes in my neck for 3 month from throat infection. They are moveable and much smaller. I left it untreated. Will i need antibiotics?	No Lymph nodes fight inflammation for a living. They will often enlarge and become tender during the process and may take a significant time to return to their normal state. As long as they are soft, movable, and gradually improving they will be fine. In any event, antibiotics are unnecessary.
6692282	I either have diarrhea or constipation. Black stool (once) Pains. Brown mucus & gas w/ constipation Little blood. Bloating. Nausea. Tired. ideas?	Medical eval needed. These changes in bowel habitus are not normal. Black stool - if tarry & malodorous could represent bleeding. The obvious blood in stool also warrants assessment. You need assessment to see if you have an inflammatory or infectious condition that is causing these changes. Take care.
965488	Have pid. Finish meds. Doc suspect uti.  How is that diagnosed?  Have burning when urinate and itching and burning in vagina.  Is PID linked to this	Yes Your doctor visually examines your external genitals for signs of infection. Next, your doctor places an instrument (speculum) into your vagina to hold the vaginal walls open so that he or she can examine the vagina and cervix. Your doctor may collect a sample of any vaginal discharge for examination under a microscope or to perform a vaginal culture test, if needed.
505685	My two year old has red spots on her chest back legs and arms it is not a rash but individual spots she has been diagnosed with dermatitis previous bu?	Rash There are different causes of red spots - allergies including contact dermatitis, viral infections, bacterial infections, insect bites. Needs to see pcp to make the diagnosis.
1249614	Pregnancy? I've been spotting for a week and half. My last period was on 5th, unprotected sex on 17th, ovulated 19th. Is it normal to spot that long? I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.	Monitor cycle Monitor your menstrual cycles and length of bleeding/cycle. Repeat pregnancy test in 2 weeks and consult with your private gyn.

1392143	Can a shingles rash start flat and itchy before blisters develop? I had ch px as a child. Just developed a rash on the right side of my chest	Yes. Yes, in fact that's the most common way it starts. Shingles is almost always on only one side of the body, often in a "stripe" like pattern. The lesion go from flat reddish, to clear blisters, to cloudy blisters, to open blisters, to crusted lesions. Early treatment with a type of antiviral drug can reduce the risk of chronic pain afterward (post-herpetic neuralgia). See doctor soon.
124816	Should I worry about my 2 yr old pulling her hair out as she lays down for her nap? Bald spot forming in back. Spoke to ped didn't seem concerned	Worth watching You don't indicate how long this has gone on and if something has changed in the child's life. Hair twirling often is a self-soothing behavior that may indicate the child is feeling under some type of stress. It well may pass on its own. If it does not, consider meeting with a young-child mental health specialist to discuss possible causes.
508436	Havnt come on period yet and 2 ovulation test have been positive could i be pregnant even tho i havnt come on ? Come of Depo-Provera 6 mnths ago ?	Do a blood pT Blood measures down to 5 miu so u will know one way or the other.

1525090	Neg allergy testing, successful sinus  surgery, use daily saline rinse but chronic copious thick post nasal drip for years. What are possible reasons?	Allergy? Many sufferers of chronic sinusitis are made miserable by environmental allergens that aren't on a standard allergy screen, or show a false negative reaction. I suggest repeat testing along the way to rule out any false negatives. Surgery can affect secretions and ciliary function on a sort-term(1-3 days) basis.
1607870	Are side-fillings recommended for tooth sensitivity? Have sensitive area and dentist says he can do side-fillings.Says there is no decay, though...	Other Alternatives Do the teeth actually have defects (toothbrush abrasion - no decay) or just receded gums? There are topical fluoride gels and rinses that can be tried first. Crest makes a Sensi-Stop strip that might do the trick for you.
1170881	Had protected sex.Period (seemed lighter but lasted normal 5 days.)ended but breasts feel bigger, have back/abdominal cramps  can this be pregnancy?	Birds and Bees One cannot get pregnant without sperm. By your question there was no sperm and thus this is not pregnancy. Having a period is the physical definition of not being pregnant. Pregnancy stops vaginal bleeding. You are not pregnant.
260957	I used an antibacterial black soap on my face to get rid of acne and my skin didn't react to well to it. Two days later my skin started to peel off.Then im getting these facial scabs that really burn.Im using aloe vera right now but it dosent seem to work	Steroid You probably need a topical steroid that your dermatologist can prescribe to you.

Cervicl radiculopath It is possible that you have cervical radiculopathy but the CT or MRI should have seen that. Usually however this does not manifest with face tingling around the eyes and nose. Bells palsy is also a possibility as this would not show up on an MRI or CT scan. I'm curious to know if you saw a neurologist as this would be a good specialist to see.
1497489	After drinking a cocktail burning pain in right shoulder between neck and shoulder tip and down right arm.  What causes this?  Pcp says not heart.	Shoulder pain If you are right handed and were drinking the cocktail with your right hand, it may well be a cause in your shoulder such as impingment or the trapezius muscle causing pain.

407096	A red-shouldered hawk has a nest in my front yard.  Today it swooped by me.  Its talons scratched my head.  It bled a little. I've cleaned it with alcohol and used neosporin.  Is that enough?  I had a tetanus short four years ago.	I I was fascinated by your question and so i took some time researching it. (i went to the military medical school where we studied things like this). It is probably better that this was a red-shouldered hawk rather than it's close relative the red tailed hawk. I am not an infectious disease specialist. So, you may need input from one (there is one infectious disease doctor that periodically answers question on avvo.Com). The red tailed hawk can carry sarcocystis which would normally only present a danger to humans if eating uncooked fowl. However there were some reports of infection by bite or scratch. Both the red - shouldered hawk and the red tailed hawk can carry west nile virus. The red shoulder hawk can carry toxoplasma gondii, which is normally only transmitted to humans via eating uncooked fowl. The birds feces can also contain the organisms. So, here is my concern, if the tallons are contaminated by feces- would a scratch be a easy vehicle for human infection. So, the only thing i can tell you, is that your tetanus shot is up to date. You will need to get input from someone with more knowledge than i have, to see if you are at risk for any of the above mentioned infections.

Meanwhile, our body constantly strives to undergo self-healing as long as we provide suitable inside and outside environments for our body. So, in 1-2 weeks, most of healing process should be completed. If symptoms persist, one needs to consider something else.

792448	Can anything be done to reduce or eliminate snoring?   My husband doesn't have sleep apnea but his snoring prevents us from sharing a bed.

Do not assume that he doesn't have sleep apnea unless he has had an overnight sleep study. There are treatments to reposition, to use breathing strips to nose, dental appliances, CPAP & surgery.
1031618	What type of ear plugs are best for sleeping?	Personalize So long as you don't have issues with otitis externa (outer ear infections) any type should be fine. Try the foam ones but, make sure to check them daily to make sure they're intact; you don't want one to break up in your ear canal because you've used it for too long.

1365231	Right breast and arm feels numb/weak. Both heats up to the point it feels cold. Right hand as well followed by tingles. Lower back. Any ideas/causes?	Depends on details Pay careful attention to what part of right arm and breast are numb. "Heats up toe the point it feels cold" may be autonomic dysfunction. Pay attention to specifically what part of arm tingles. If low back is related then combination of arm and low back in setting of otherwise healthy young woman may mean stress biology (in which case tests probably normal). Quite treatable after diagnosis.
1567888	How long should I wait to get tested after having receptive anal sex? In particular I want to get tested for RECTAL chlamydia+gonhorrea+syphilis.	STI testing time Two weeks after potential exposure should be a good time to be tested and I would add HIV to the list. Practicing safe sex is essential in protecting yourself from these STIs.

Becau 88 year old female. Good health but fear of a possible  stroke if she has surgery. Has tried
many pain relievers but nothing seems to help. She also has neuropathy in her feet. She is not a dia	I I like the idea of acupuncture particularly electrical acupuncture particularly given the request was for alternatives. A combination of approaches often work best though: topical anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, injections, and general measures to effectively deal with pain are worth a try. For example, if any sleep disturbances are present make sure they are addressed. Occasional nutritional problems can contribute to pain..B12, vitamin d..To mention a few. You are right not to be satisfied with the only answer being surgery! most often other alternatives can and do work.

6787718	I used fluticasone nasal spray caused me not to smell nose dry doc said nostrils swollen tried saltwater nose feels heavy air feels obstructed ?	See ENT It is unusual for fluticasone to cause dryness in the nose. You need to make sure that you are aiming the spray towards the lateral side of the nose and not straight in. Consider trying other nasal steroid options. If the problem persists, see an ENT. If you were much older or have had turbinates reduced, then I would consider dryness as the issue and use saline spray instead.

244838	I had a steroid injection in my knee 2 weeks ago and it's more painful now than it was before. Was to treat patella tendonitis. Should it be?	Right diagnosis? You should go back to the one who injected you. Sometimes a post injection flare can happen but should have resolved by now. Need to be sure there is no infection. This increased pain could also just be a worsening of your condition. Get checked out.

Unlikely but see doc Please see your doctor. Given your age, breast cancer is very unlikely. However, you need to find out what this is. Very likely this is something benign - perhaps a cyst that ruptured, or a small area of fat necrosis.

277695	Is it ok to alternate zyrtec(prescribed) and Benadryl (otc) for a few days for an allergy attack. Would be z in am and b at pm. 17mth old male	Maybe Zyrtec makes some people sleepy. They basically work the same but Benadryl works for just a few hours and usually causes more sleepiness. May want to try Allegra (otc generic is fine) in morning if zyrtec causes sleepiness.

Hypertrophic scar This is an overgrown scar that can itch. See your doctor who performed the procedure. A cortisone injection done monthly for 1-3 months, will probably help. This does not get into your bloodstream, since it is given into the scar. This is known as an intralesional injection.
1555525	I take a sleep aid at night. Valerian root, lemon balm, l-theanine, hops, chamomile, passion flower & melatonin. Do any of these thin my blood?	Interesting question I can't help but wonder why you asked. Homeopathic doses of these herbal supplements should not thin your blood.

Bumps The presence of lymph node enlargement as describes suggests that the head and neck is fighting an infection. The original hairline lump was likely to be the sourse of the infection. The persistence of a lump after this amount of time needs review by a doctor. Probably this can be addressed by your primary care/family medicine doctor.

Re-test at 7 days There is a good chance that implantation has not occurred yet or that you are not producing HCG at a high enough level to be detected by a home pregnancy test. For best results, it is still recommended to wait until a woman has missed her period or 14 days past ovulation. For those that just can't wait, the very earliest you should test is seven days past ovulation.
688872	My boyfriend has small, dark purplish pimples around his teaticles and thought area. Is it an std? They itch supposedly.

I had started having pain and what felt like a lump and swelling on the right side of mu throat, then my ear started hurt	More than strep The doctor treated you for a (R) otitis media(ear infection) with an acute pharyngitis(sore throat) that possibly was strep. Next symptoms might be a Tonsillitis or a refractory ear infection that involves the estuation tube. Might benefit from increased humidification , decongestants, but they help a little. Best treatment would be a short course of oral steroids to drain better.
6718132	Can you get the flu with no runny nose or sneezing .just a headache ,sore throat,and body aches ?	Typical influenza Although flu (influenza) can cause nasal congestion and sneezing, often it does not. Your symptoms are very typical -- especially if you have fever and also develop a cough. However, you shouldn't assume the diagnosis, and flu season is over. So see your doctor -- if s/he believes influenza is likely, treatment with an antiviral drug like oseltamivir (Tamflu) may speed recovery. Good luck!
485832	What could be the cause of foul smelling watery white vaginal discharge that is more than usual other than chlamydia or gonorrhoeae?	Other causes Trichomonas or bacterial vaginosis would be other most likely causes.
730919	Not sexually active. Red painful lump on left labia minora. No whit head visible but hurts like a pimple. Is it really serious or can I home-cure it?	Sounds like a... Pimple or infected inclusion cyst (benign. ) i would treat it with warm compresses just like you would a pimple and see if it comes to a head. If it doesn't improve in a day or so or worsens, you should see your doctor.

My concern is i spent approximatley 48 hrs in hospital with no low grade fe	Since Since you posted this question five days ago, you've probably addressed this issue by now. Naturally, a fever in someone who's got a kidney stone -- whether it's in the bladder or still in the ureter -- raises the question of a urinary tract infection. If you're already taking an antibiotic, this is something that can wait until you can call your doctor unless you're developing other worrisome symptoms. Alternatively, if you spent two days in the hospital, your fever may simply be due to pulmonary atelectasis, a condition that results from prolonged bed rest. When you're immobilized, small areas of your lungs become compressed, and this triggers a low-grade fever. Taking frequent deep breaths and moving about is usually all it takes to deal with atelectasis. At any rate, i hope things have settled down and you're now feeling better.
6732062	Red leathery patch on bottom of penis shaft and the top of scrotum. Not very itchy but wet to the touch. Sometimes swells up. Treatment options?	Dry Keep the area dry and use nystatin powder

Normal Most women bleed irregularly for at least the first 12 weeks on depo provera. Provera is thinning out the lining of your uterus called the endometrium. As it atrophies it will break off and you will have irregular bleeding. Almost everyone has this as a normal side effect of the depo.

Always best to rule out pregnancy first.
1253784	Please tell me what vitamin defficiency causes leg and foot pain/cramping/soreness?	It sounds like More than a vitamin deficiency is going on. Have you ruled out other causes? Magnesium is usually good for muscle cramps but if your complaining of pain i'd look for all possible causes.

Viral to make the clinical diagnosis she should have some red spots and her soles or palms in addition to the mouth. Unfortunately, there is no known treatment for the virus. Just push fluids
6697526	Non itchy skin color raised patch no scale over both elbows & knees, all of same duration treated with mild steroid no response. probable diagnosis?	Difficult to know A chronic rash is difficult to diagnose without more information about you and visualization of the rash. A Virtual consult may help. With the information given, granuloma annulare comes to mind. Usually there is a central depression within a ring sized flesh colored patch. If stretched, you will likely see smaller papules. They sometimes herald thyroid disease. Low potency steroids fail.

60292	I have heart disease and extremely large breasts what can I do to shrink my breasts safely without surgery or is that my only option?

1415068	What do you suggest if my doctor put me on loratadine 10mg antihistamine, one tablet every 24 Benadryl after I've already taken loratadine for 2 days now?	Depends on Problem If you were put on loratadine for allergies and it is not responding to the medication you can take the loratadine in the morning and Benadryl at night. But, there are other allergy medicine that may help you more. I would suggest letting your doctor know you are not getting relief. Also, be careful with Benadryl as it can be sedating and driving with it is a DUI in many states.
6767491	I just had knee replacement surgery. I am feeling shall pain at the attachment. I've gain a little weight, is that the reason?	It is very common to have pain at the "attachments" since they are after all "foreign bodies" and the interface can hurt much like any joint feels on occasion. .(Especially in damp weather right??? If your walling is normal..relax...and enjoy your new knee! Hope this helps! Dr Z

They look a little like skin tags but i've never had them before. I noticed i just started ge	These These could be skin tags or warts. Try putting on a little white vinegar, if they turn white chances are that they are warts. Warts may grow or appear in pregnancy because of the associated immunosuppression.

90787	Pain on top of left shoulder, left elbow, left forearm, wrist and ring finger and knuckle and slight pain in left upper chest. What could this be?	Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia can cause widespread pain such as what you describe. You may feel as if there is swelling and morning stiffness but no visible evidence of swelling.

Environmental factor Symptoms suggest an environmental factor triggering skin problems. Possibly pollution, allergy, lake effect, or other cause. Best to check with dermatologist for help.
900277	I just got done being sick from whatever illness. I have a fever, body aches, & a really bad sore throat. &some how an ear infection too. Why is this happening?	Many Causes You likely have a viral illness. Many viruses cause illnesses like yours; the flu is one. Viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics and must run their course. But you can also develop a bacterial infection, which does require antibiotics. Common sites are the throat, ears, and sinuses. You may want to see your doctor if the throat/ear pain continue or if any of your symptoms worsen.
1488098	Have calcified vein in pelvis.Radiologist report says unidentified ideology.( Also have kidney stones) Isn't that a phlebolith? Why then have a CT ?	Not sure. Sometimes a phlebolith can't be differentiated from a distal ureter stone on xray, and a CT is done to make the distinction. Perhaps the calcified vein is a larger vein than the small veins associated with phleboliths, and further evaluation is needed. But I can't be sure based on limited info. Try discussing the need for a ct with your doc.
404615	Is there an effective non-antibiotic treatment for an inner ear infection? I have had reactions to tetracycline, amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin and smz/tmp 800-160.

Continue daily antihistamines and your flonase. Be sure that you are taking a true sudafed decongestant.

739995	How can I remove semen from my vagina after sex to prevent pregnancy?	Cannot Once seminal fluid containing sperm enters a woman's vagina, it is not possible to remove all the sperm to reliably prevent pregnancy.

See MD/DO first An upper posterior tooth's roots are into or near the sinus cavity, and an ear infection can create some pain with the tooth/teeth.

605245	I had a yeast infection a few weeks ago and now I have a rash on my vagina...No itching burning or odor. Is that normal?	Hard to say The yeast infection may have caused some itching/burning, irritation of the vagina.

232575	How long do you have to have chlamydia to develop pelvic inflammatory disease pid?	Unknown There is no magic number. It all depends on your body and your immunity. If your immunity is low the disease can reek havoc. If it is high it will keep the progression of the disease in check.

1287381	I have white heads on my face and my skin is oily. Also I have acne marks . What cream or facewash should I use to get rid of all? Please help me	See a dermatologist Meanwhile, try otc Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (cream). Ask for the lowest %. Keep it off any nice fabrics as it bleaches them (but does not bleach skin). It is drying and can be irritating. Acne is sometimes related to medicines, but is mostly a matter of hormones (puberty in your case) and is largely determined by heredity. It is not your diet, hygiene, or stress. Treatment of significant acne requires.
914659	Frequency and burning pee but no UTI and no std! what could it be?	May still have UTI Those are symptoms of UTI or injury to the urethra or bladder. Even though culture may be negative, you may have a viral uti. Frequent sexual intercourse or inserting a foreign body into vagina also may cause these symptoms. Other rare causes of cystitis (infection of urinary bladder) may be a stone, tumor, blood clots in the urine, and others. If your symptoms persist, i would consult a urologist.

Many possibilities Itchy facial rash can be from allergic reaction to drugs, chemicals, cosmetics, insect bites and many others. Start with your primary care doctor for examination and treatment.
98840	Should both mammogram and sonogram be done forlarge breasts?	What is the question Hello t0myy322. I am not sure what your question is, but mammography is the generally accepted standard for radiographic screening for breast cancer. Breast size should not matter. Ultrasound is not appropriate for screening, but can be used if a specific area of the breast is of concern. Mri is also used under certain circumstances.
1287470	I have a fear of getting lukemia or lung cancer from one chest CT scan which i had one month ago. Is it dangerous to have CT scan? Can i get cancer ?	Perspective The risk is too small to measure reliably, and the claims i've seen about diagnostic x-rays causing thousands of cases of cancer yearly look to me to be flawed. You also need to be aware that you're exposed to background radiation constantly that makes up a far greater amount of your exposure. Dna mutates even from quantum fluctuations. If you still can't manage this fear, your doctor can help.
